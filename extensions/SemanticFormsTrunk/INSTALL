== Disclaimer ==

There is no guarantee that any of Semantic Forms' functionality will
work on your system. On the other hand, the code does not make any
modifications to the database directly, so it should be a low-risk
installation.

For a proper legal disclaimer, see the file "COPYING".

== Requirements ==

The extension requires an install of Semantic MediaWiki 1.4 or
greater, as well as MediaWiki 1.14 or greater.

== Installation ==

(1) Extract the archive to obtain the directory "SemanticForms" that contains
    all relevant files. Copy this directory (or extract/download it) to
    "[wikipath]/extensions/".
(2) Insert the following line into the file "[wikipath]/LocalSettings.php":
      include_once('extensions/SemanticForms/SemanticForms.php');

'''Remark:'''  Semantic Forms creates an additional custom namespace, "Form"
(see http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Using_custom_namespaces). If you have
your own custom namespaces and you want to change the numbers used by Semantic
Forms and Semantic MediaWiki, see the file SMW_Settings.php, within
Semantic MediaWiki, for instructions.
