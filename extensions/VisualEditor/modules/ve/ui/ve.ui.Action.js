 * List of allowed methods for the action.

 * To avoid use of methods not intended to be executed via surface.execute(), the methods must be
 * whitelisted here. This information is checked by ve.ui.Surface before executing an action.
 *
 * If a method returns a value, it will be cast to boolean and be used to determine if the action
 * was canceled. Not returning anything, or returning undefined will be treated the same as
 * returning true. A canceled action will yield to other default behavior. For example, when
 * triggering an action from a keystroke, a canceled action will allow normal insertion behavior to
 * be carried out.
