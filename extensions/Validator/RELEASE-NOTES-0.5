Validator 0.5 was released on 2012-10-05.

=== Compatibility changes ===

* Changed minimum MediaWiki version from 1.16 to 1.17.
* Full compatibility with MediaWiki 1.19 and MediaWiki 1.20 and forward-compatibility with 1.21.

=== New features ===

* New light-weight array definition of ParamDefinition objects supported.
* Added DimensionParam.
* Added ValidatorOptions class of which an instance can be passed to Validator
: to globally change precessing behaviour. The most notable new option is the
: 'rawStringParameters' one, which when set to true (default) will expect values
: in string format, and when set to false (new capability) will expect values
: in their native formats (ie lists should be actual array objects).

=== Enhancements ===

* Split Parameter into Param and ParamDefinition classes.
** ParamDefinition objects each represent a type and contain the
:: logic to validate and manipulate values.
** Param objects hold a ParamDefinition, the user provided value,
:: and processing state.
* Added several new options to various of the ParamDefinition objects that
: where not available in earlier criteria and manipulation objects.
* Added tests for all ParamDefinition objects.
* Added high level tests for Validator and tests for ValidatorOptions.

=== Deprecated features ===

* Deprecated Parameter (and deriving) classes.
* Deprecated ParameterCriterion (and deriving) classes.
* Deprecated ParameterManipulation (and deriving) classes.
* Deprecated the constructor method of the Validator class.

=== Extended translations ===
