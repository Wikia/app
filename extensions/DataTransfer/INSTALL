== Disclaimer ==

Data Transfer is a new extension, and there is no guarantee that
any of it will work on your system. However, it does not make
any modifications to the database, so it should be a low-risk
installation.

For a proper legal disclaimer, see the file "COPYING".

== Requirements ==

The extension can make use of, but does not require, an install of
Semantic MediaWiki. If Semantic MediaWiki is used, it must be of
version 0.6 or greater. For more details, see Semantic MediaWiki's
own installation requirements.

== Installation ==

(1) Extract the archive to obtain the directory "DataTransfer"
    that contains all relevant files. Copy this directory (or
    extract/download it) to "[wikipath]/extensions/".
(2) Insert the following line into the file "[wikipath]/LocalSettings.php":
      include_once('extensions/DataTransfer/includes/DT_Settings.php');
