== Wikilog 1.1.0 ==

Aug 8, 2010

=== General notes ===

Database schema changed since 1.0.x, a database update is required.
You should backup your data and run maintenance/update.php to upgrade.

MediaWiki requirement raised to 1.15.0 and later. MediaWiki 1.14 and earlier
are no longer supported in this release, stick with Wikilog 1.0.x if this is
your case.

=== New configuration options ===

* $wgWikilogExtSummaries: use of categories and tags parameters in summary
  entry header and footer messages.
* $wgWikilogExpensiveLimit: configures how many items to show on pages that
  includes other pages (expensive requests that may demand article parsing).
  Replaces $wgWikilogSummaryLimit.
* $wgWikilogNumComments: default number of comments to show at once on
  discussion pages.

=== New features ===

* Messages wikilog-item-brief-header/footer, wikilog-item-header/footer and
  others replaced by wikilog-summary-header/footer, wikilog-entry-header/
  footer and others, with better support for plural and gender inflection,
  separate date and time, and also support to category and tag lists.
* (wl:issue 2) Improved article summary extraction. Now a "--more--" marker
  alone in a line breaks the summary (above) from the rest of the article
  (below). The <summary> tag has precedence over this new marker. If neither
  is found, the first section is used.
* Improved customization of article comments pages. Now, comment headers and
  footers are can be configured through messages wikilog-comment-header/
  footer and others.
* More user-friendly navigation bars. Currently, they only have first,
  last, previous and next links. Support for other MediaWiki features, like
  items-per-page will come later.
* Discussion pages are now paged, i.e., only a maximum number of comments
  (default 50) are shown at once, with paging links to visit other pages of
  comments.
* Comment syndication feeds are now available. Currently, there is one feed
  per wikilog article, that lists comments made to that article. In the
  future, feeds per thread, per wikilog and global may be provided.
* Added support for MediaWiki 1.16 Vector skin.
* Special:Wikilog now allows querying by namespace, with the "Namespace:*"
  syntax.
