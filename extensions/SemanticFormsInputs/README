Semantic Forms Inputs is an extension to MediaWiki that provides
additional input types for the Semantic Forms extension.

The Semantic Forms extension allows users to add, edit and query data
of a Semantic MediaWiki-based wiki using forms. For every form field
the input type specifies the type of input a field will have in the
form. Semantic Forms comes with basic input types for all data
types. This extension -- Semantic Forms Inputs -- aims to collect
further, visually and/or functionally enhanced input types.

== Installation ==

Having at least MediaWiki 1.16, Semantic MediaWiki 1.5.4 and Semantic
Forms 2.3.1 installed is a precondition for the Semantic Forms Inputs
extension version 0.5 and above; the code will not work without it.

To install Semantic Forms Inputs, create a directory named
SemanticFormsInputs in the extensions directory of your MediaWiki
installation and copy the extension's files into it. Then add the
following line to your LocalSettings.php below the inclusion of the
Semantic Forms extension:

require_once( "$IP/extensions/SemanticFormsInputs/SemanticFormsInputs.php" );
