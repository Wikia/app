[[Semantic Maps 0.3.4]]

Make sure you have Semantic MediaWiki and Maps successfully installed before
proceeding with the installation. Once you have downloaded the code, place
the 'SemanticMaps' directory within your MediaWiki 'extensions' directory.
Then add the following code to your LocalSettings.php file after the lines
that install Maps:

# Semantic Maps
require_once( "$IP/extensions/SemanticMaps/SemanticMaps.php" );

The inclusion of extensions should happen in this order: Semantic MediaWiki,
Semantic Forms (if you use it), Semantic Maps. Maps should proceed Semantic
Maps. See the installation instructions of Maps for info about the API keys.
