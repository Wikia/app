===Semantic Maps 0.4===
(2009-11-03)

====Bug fixes====

* Fixed the repeated display of mapping services on the Special:Ask page, by [http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki?view=rev&revision=58187 adding an aliasing system to SMW].

* Fixed problem that caused the SM result formats to not get displayed on Special:Ask.

===Semantic Maps 0.3.4===

* [http://blog.bn2vs.com/2009/09/12/maps-and-semantic-maps-0-3-4-released/ Maps and Semantic Maps 0.3.4 released]

====Bug fixes====

* Fixed bug causing error for people who do not have Semantic Forms installed and enabled, presumably introduced in 0.3.

* Fixed bug causing only the last coordinate property from a result to be shown on a map format, and so causing the predecessors to be ignored in case of multiple coordinate properties.

====Refactoring====

* Restructured the extension to work with the new feature hook system of Maps.

===Semantic Maps 0.3.3===
(2009-08-15)

===Semantic Maps 0.3.2===
(2009-08-18)

====Bug fixes====

* Fixed logic error that caused maps to have a wrong centre and zoom when a query only returned one result.

====New functionality====

* Yahoo! Maps and OpenLayers now handle the "icon=" parameter that can come from Semantic Compound Queries, as Google Maps already did.

====Refactoring====

* Restructured the Query Printer classes (JavaScript based logic).

* Made form input classes weakly typed, so they fully work with the new aliasing system.

* Integrated the new hook system of Maps.

* Made the form input class inherit from MapsMapFeature.

====Bug fixes====

* Mapping formats get added only once, as opossed to multiple times in version 0.2.2.

* Added "elementNamePrefix" to the map names and fields of form inputs to prevent JavaScript errors.

* When a query returns no results, nothing will be displayed, instead of an empty map.

* The Google Maps form input now zooms in correctly when a user looks up an address.
