Phalanx
=======

Phalanx is Wikia antispam filter.

This version of Phalanx, called Phalanx Redux, uses external HHTP service written in Scala for checking against defined filters.

Phalanx service is currently in private repository on https://github.com/Wikia/scala-backend/tree/master/phalanx but we plan to make it open for community ASAP.
