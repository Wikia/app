these are some notes on how to hookup this special page into the email system

==here is how to generate the URL params==

we have to send 3 params in the url:
* email
* timestamp
* token

order doesnt matter, but its best to try to keep these in that order

#3 is a salted hash of #1 and #2, so you need to get 1 and 2 static before you can find #3

here is an easy way i've been doing it
$eparams = array(
	'email' => the address the mail is being sent to,
	'timestamp' => time()
	);
$eparams['token'] = wfGenerateUnsubToken($eparams['email'], $eparams['timestamp']);
/*this function exists in the Wikia global functions file, and is available (and its salt) to all wikis.
 it exists outside of this extension for  <iforget the reasons, but sean+artur+jasonc had some good ones> */
 
==here is how to generate the URL==

for now, for "easier that way" reasons, (also because theres an unsquashed bug with userdata across clusters...)
we're pointing all unsub links to central, where the master version of 'user' lives.

$unsubTitle = GlobalTitle::newFromText('Unsubscribe', NS_SPECIAL, 177);

will give us a title object pointing to http://community.wikia.com/wiki/Special:Unsubscribe

using this, just do:
 $url = $unsubTitle->getFullURL($eparams);
 
 and you've got your url
 
==inserting it into the system==

this is where i'm leaving the project to someone else.
i've tried a number of times to do so successfully, and have come against a number of roadblocks I cant get past at the moment.

here are things I know (in hopes to give <next person> an edge):

* UserMailer::send() and UserMailer::sendHtml()
read these, learn these, KNOW these. its where you will likely do your most work

* major roadblock 1
usermailer::send (for some legacy MW reason) can take an array of addresses as the TO,
and MW will construct the email headers correct to send 1 email to multiple recipients properly.

(::sendhtml does not accept multiple addreses, halts if you try, and was easier to mod)

this is a problem for us, as the unsub url has to be specific for 1 user's email.
i had asked around on IRC, and checked a bunch of extensions, and no one knows of any extensions,
(esp ones used at wikia), that actually use this mutli-TO functionality.

you have two options (i tried them both)
------------------------------------------
option alpha) change the code to REJECT mutli-TO attempts, and know after that check that email passed in is singular,
and can be used to generate the unsub link.

pro) easy quick hack, little code change to core functions
con) your changing the way a core function works, and redefining what all of known MW knows about sending email.

------------------------------------------
option beta) let the code still accept array of people, and change it to transfer a single addres into being an array of 1 item.
then change the code after that to loop over the (now, always an array) of addreses,
and on each loop (being a different address), generate a new unsub link,
and on each loop, send a seperate email for each address.

pro) you still accept multiple-TO lists, and to the outside world, the function hasnt changed.
con) substantial refactoring of code (the core stuff is legacy and old, and messy), but no real change in functionality
------------------------------------------


with either option, there is still the problem that i couldnt find a solution to,
(mostly because of lack of input, help, or management for this task)

where to add the actual link (and text) to each message body?

the crude method i was told to use, was just append it to the message body and "deal with this later",
but later has to come eventually, so what ever choice you make, know that you will have to "fix" it later

the stickler being, there are 2 types of emails really:
* email notification (enotif, aka, watchlist)
* non-watchlist

both of the mail functions get passed a "Category" parameter, to identify what type of email it is (used in tracking headers that happens elsewhere).
you NEED to check this, as there are some of these that you DONT want to append a unsub to.
examples:
* SpecialContact (which gets sent to comteam in RT)
* SpecialContactCC (which gets sent to users as a copy of their just sent Special:Contact submition)
there are more, but the project fell apart in testing before i could go down the list.
the full list of types is in dataware.email_types. and uberfuzzy has a list of text descriptions somewhere

check with Artur, or the CAN-SPAM text its self, on which type of emails we need to have an unsub on:
transactional vs non-transational.
which boils down to "i pushed a button" vs "automated" mostly

the (most) of our emails system works, is done with "template" messages.
lots of $VARIABLE type things that get replaced at some stage of the code.
lots of $VARIALES exists, that arent used, or can be used, or were-used and removed.

these "templates" are in the code someplace, but most have been over-written on messaging over the years.
also, each of them likely has a translation version (also on messaging)
also, each wiki can in theory also override this (but only a few wikis have ever done so)

it would be nice if we could use these, and hack in a $UNSUBLINK variable that could be added to the templates,
and let the replacer system add it into the message.

but, we cant depend on (staff, translators, wikis) to keep this in their templates,
and we HAVE to have this link in all emails for CAN-SPAM reasons (i think).
so we HAVE to just blindly, and crudely, and ugly-ly, append it to the body text.

note:
the ::send() sends plain text emails
the ::sendHtml() sends *surprise* html emails

but you have to make changes to both.

the reason i bring this up, is that in good html email protocol,
HTML email contains a plain text version that limited mail readers can fall back to
(lots of MIME boundry magic stuff here that you dont have to worry about, there are functions that do this)

so, if at all possible, try to keep the changes to the plain text versions body the same in both functions.

---------------------------------
one last problem i never solved:

the actual text(s) (slightly different wording is needed based on your plain/html linking)
your going to put in the emails, needs to be defined, and needs to get translated ASAP.

i didnt add it to this extensions, as its not really part of this extension.
it needs to be put somewhere global, so that no matter what "wiki scope" the email generation happens,
it can get to these messages (this extension might only be enabled on central, i never got an answer)





this is pretty much everything i know about this project,
 and i wish the best to who ever manager to get this hooked into the mail system.
 
oh, and what ever you do/change TEST STUFF. email is the lifeblood of wikis, and we break stuff far too often.
