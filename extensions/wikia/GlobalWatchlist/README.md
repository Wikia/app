# Global Watchlist

The global watchlist is used to send out a weekly digest of changes to all pages a user is watching across Wikia. It
works using a combination of hooks built into the local watchlist flow and the [Job Queue](https://one.wikia-inc.com/wiki/Engineering/Job_Queue).
To understand how the system works, it helps to have a quick overview of how the local watchlist system works:

## Local Watchlist
When a user (let's call them User A) makes an edit to a page or explicitly starts following a page, they are added to the local
watchlist table for that wiki. That entry looks something like this:

	+----------+--------------+-----------+--------------------------+-------------------------+
	| wl_user  | wl_namespace | wl_title  | wl_notificationtimestamp | wl_wikia_addedtimestamp |
	+----------+--------------+-----------+--------------------------+-------------------------+
	| 23910443 |            0 | TestPage  | NULL                     |   2015-02-02 15:37:09   | User A
	+----------+--------------+-----------+--------------------------+-------------------------+
	Ex 1

Note the value of `NULL` for the `wl_notificationtimestamp` field. This is used to indicate that User A is watching the
page, but has seen the latest version. When a second user, User B, comes along and edits that page, three things
happen. First, an email is sent to User A informing them the page they were watching has changed. Next, a new entry
is added to the local watchlist table for User B indicating that they are now watching the page. Finally, the row for
User A is updated with the current timestamp to indicate they were notified about the change.

	+----------+--------------+-----------+--------------------------+-------------------------+
	| wl_user  | wl_namespace | wl_title  | wl_notificationtimestamp | wl_wikia_addedtimestamp |
	+----------+--------------+-----------+--------------------------+-------------------------+
	| 23910443 |            0 | TestPage  | 20150202153859           |  2015-01-20 23:19:21    | User A
	+----------+--------------+-----------+--------------------------+-------------------------+
	| 23910444 |            0 | TestPage  | NULL                     |  2015-02-02 15:38:59    | User B
	+----------+--------------+-----------+--------------------------+-------------------------+
	Ex 2

If a third user, User C, comes along and edits the page, the process is similar but for one key difference. Because
User A has already been notified about the last change (and therefore has a time stamp in their `wl_notificationtimestamp`
field), they will not be sent an email a second time informing them of the change. Nothing effectively happens for that user.
User B however will receive a notification email, and the table will be updated accordingly.

	+----------+--------------+-----------+--------------------------+-------------------------+
	| wl_user  | wl_namespace | wl_title  | wl_notificationtimestamp | wl_wikia_addedtimestamp |
	+----------+--------------+-----------+--------------------------+-------------------------+
	| 23910443 |            0 | TestPage  | 20150202153859           |  2015-02-02 15:37:09    | User A
	+----------+--------------+-----------+--------------------------+-------------------------+
	| 23910444 |            0 | TestPage  | 20150202154342           |  2015-02-02 15:38:59    | User B
	+----------+--------------+-----------+--------------------------+-------------------------+
	| 23910445 |            0 | TestPage  | NULL                     |  2015-02-02 15:43:43    | User C
	+----------+--------------+-----------+--------------------------+-------------------------+
	Ex 3

As soon as User A revisits the page, their `wl_notificationtimestamp` is set back to NULL and they will receive a
notification the next time the page is edited.

	+----------+--------------+-----------+--------------------------+-------------------------+
	| wl_user  | wl_namespace | wl_title  | wl_notificationtimestamp | wl_wikia_addedtimestamp |
	+----------+--------------+-----------+--------------------------+-------------------------+
	| 23910443 |            0 | TestPage  | NULL                     |  2015-02-02 15:37:09    | User A
	+----------+--------------+-----------+--------------------------+-------------------------+
	| 23910444 |            0 | TestPage  | 20150202154342           |  2015-02-02 15:38:59    | User B
	+----------+--------------+-----------+--------------------------+-------------------------+
	| 23910445 |            0 | TestPage  | NULL                     |  2015-02-02 15:43:43    | User C
	+----------+--------------+-----------+--------------------------+-------------------------+
	Ex 4

## Global Watchlist
The global watchlist ties into the local watchlist process described above. It serves as a central record for all pages
across Wikia a user is watching which have changed, but they have not visited yet. Here's the general flow:

Whenever a page is updated, all user's who had seen the latest version up to that point are notified via email and have
their `wl_notificationtimestamp` field updated in the `watchlist` table (Ex 2 above). At that point, a hook is fired
which sends a job via the Job Queue to have that user added to the `global_watchlist` table. After Ex 2 above, the
`global_watchlist` table would look something like this:

	+--------+-------------+-------------+---------------+----------------+------------+----------------+-------------------+
	| gwa_id | gwa_user_id | gwa_city_id | gwa_namespace | gwa_title      | gwa_rev_id | gwa_timestamp  | gwa_rev_timestamp |
	+--------+-------------+-------------+---------------+----------------+------------+----------------+-------------------+
	|     86 |   23910443  |      435087 |             0 | TestPage       |      53755 | 20150202153859 |  20150202153859   | User A
	+--------+-------------+-------------+---------------+----------------+------------+----------------+-------------------+

Once that row has been added to `global_watchlist`, a job is scheduled to kick off exactly 7 days in the future which will
send that user a weekly digest of all the changes they haven't seen on their watched pages. So if 2 other pages User A
is watching are changed later on, the `global_watchlist` is updated with 2 additional rows.

	+--------+-------------+-------------+---------------+----------------+------------+----------------+-------------------+
	| gwa_id | gwa_user_id | gwa_city_id | gwa_namespace | gwa_title      | gwa_rev_id | gwa_timestamp  | gwa_rev_timestamp |
	+--------+-------------+-------------+---------------+----------------+------------+----------------+-------------------+
	|     86 |    23910443 |      435087 |             0 | TestPage       |      53755 | 20150202153859 |  20150202153859   | User A
	+--------+-------------+-------------+---------------+----------------+------------+----------------+-------------------+
	|     88 |    23910443 |       26337 |             0 | GleeTestPage   |    2540196 | 20150202184358 | 20150202184358    | User A
	+--------+-------------+-------------+---------------+----------------+------------+----------------+-------------------+
	|     89 |    23910443 |         831 |             0 | MuppetTestPage |     773845 | 20150202184620 | 20150202184620    | User A
	+--------+-------------+-------------+---------------+----------------+------------+----------------+-------------------+

If user A visits any of those pages before the weekly digest is run, that row will be deleted from the global_watchlist table.
So if they were to visit the MuppetTestPage, the table would then look like:

	+--------+-------------+-------------+---------------+----------------+------------+----------------+-------------------+
	| gwa_id | gwa_user_id | gwa_city_id | gwa_namespace | gwa_title      | gwa_rev_id | gwa_timestamp  | gwa_rev_timestamp |
	+--------+-------------+-------------+---------------+----------------+------------+----------------+-------------------+
	|     86 |    23910443 |      435087 |             0 | TestPage       |      53755 | 20150202153859 |  20150202153859   | User A
	+--------+-------------+-------------+---------------+----------------+------------+----------------+-------------------+
	|     88 |    23910443 |       26337 |             0 | GleeTestPage   |    2540196 | 20150202184358 | 20150202184358    | User A
	+--------+-------------+-------------+---------------+----------------+------------+----------------+-------------------+

When that job finally runs which sends out the weekly notifications, the `global_watchlist` table is queried for all rows for User A.
The digest is then prepared and sent out to them. At that point those rows are deleted from the `global_watchlist` table,
and the corresponding rows in the local watchlist tables have their `wl_notificationtimestamp` fields set to null (which
means the user will be notified about the next change going forward).

If a user ever unsubscribes from the Weekly Digest, or unsubscribes from all email from Wikia, all of their rows will be
deleted from the `global_watchlist` table. New rows will not be added for them until they resubscribe, and any scheduled
jobs to send out the Weekly Digest for that user will not actually send out the digest.
