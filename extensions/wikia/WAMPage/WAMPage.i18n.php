WAM is a custom measurement developed by Wikia to capture a number of independent indicators into one overall index, like the Billboard or Parker score. It’s based on weighted algorithm of unique users, page views, momentum, multi-media and more.

The WAM is calculated daily for the top 5,000 Wikis and includes an overall and vertical rank as well as a score from 0 to 100. The WAM rankings are sensitive to real-world events and change frequently, so be sure to check back regularly to see the latest trends. The WAM can also be viewed daily on each of our [[Video Games|Video Game]], [[Entertainment]] and [[Lifestyle]] hub pages.',
	'wampage-faq' => '__NOTOC__===How is the WAM calculated?===
	The WAM rank is a combination of traffic, engagement and growth. We are not able to provide the specifics because we do not want Wikis attempting to manipulate the rankings. But rest assured, we have included all the essential ingredients for a successful and thriving Wiki.
===Why should I care about the WAM?===
	At Wikia we believe knowledge is power. While we have always been open about data and statistics, the WAM represents a huge step forward in the measurement of online communities. The WAM is a valuable feedback loop for founders, admins and contributors as they look to better understand where their Wiki ranks and how their activity is moving the needle.
===How can I improve my WAM score?===
	The WAM is a complex algorithm, and there isn’t a simple way to instantly improve your score and ranking. That said, there are steps you can take that will put you in a good position to move up the ranks. First and foremost, we suggest that you encourage participation on your Wiki. Wikis that have a large number of active contributions and contributors are more likely to do well in the WAM rankings. But it is important to remember that you can’t game the system. The more authentic and relevant the content is, the more likely it will resonate with your readers.

	We also recommend reaching out to your fellow contributors to see if there are improvements you can make to the Wiki. Is the navigation intuitive? Do you have enough rich media (videos & images)?  Are there gaps in the content?  Of course, we can help guide you in the right direction.

===How much historical WAM data is available?===
	WAM data goes back to January 1, 2012

===Where is the WAM currently displayed?===
	You can currently find the WAM on this product page, the [[Video Games|Video Game]], [[Entertainment]] and [[Lifestyle]] hub pages, and the preview interstitial page for each Wiki.

===Am I allowed to display my WAM score on my Wiki?===
We encourage you to display your WAM score or rank on your Wiki, but we ask you that you link back to the product page. In the coming months we will be rolling out tools that will make it easier to display the WAM on your Wiki.

===Who can I speak to if I have other questions about the WAM?===
