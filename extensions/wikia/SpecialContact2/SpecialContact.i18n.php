You may want to start by posting in your community forum. 

If the local admins are not active, you can submit a request for admin status. Please visit the [[w:c:adopt|adoption wiki]] for more information, including the adoption criteria and the request page. Please remember to always provide a link to the wiki you wish to adopt.

If there's an active user community on the wiki you wish to adopt, please start a discussion on the wiki about who would make the best admins, and why you would like to become one. Please provide a link to this discussion at the [[w:c:adopt|Adoption wiki]]. Best of luck and happy editing!

*Not able to create an account? It may be that you are not eligible for an account at this time. See [[w:c::wikia:Wikia:Terms_of_use#Membership|terms of use]] for more details.
*Lost your password? You can request a new password [[Special:Signup|here]] Once there, enter your username, and click the \"new password\" button. You will then receive an email with a new temporary password. You can use this to sign in and update your password to one of your choice. 

If you have done all of these and are still having an issue - please send us a detailed report below. We will get back to you as soon as possible to help fix the problem.

Wikia has many wikis on all sorts of subjects and we'd love for you to stick around and find the one that's right for you. If you are having a local problem with your wiki, please don't hesitate to contact your [[Special:Listusers/sysop|local admins]] for help and advice.

If you have decided you definitely want to disable your account please be aware that Wikia does not have the ability to fully remove accounts, but we can disable them. This will ensure the account is locked and can't be used. This process is NOT reversible, and you will have to create a new account if you wish to rejoin Wikia. However, this process will not remove your contributions from a given wiki as these contributions belong to the community as a whole.

If you need any more information on what an account disable actually does, you can visit our [[Help:Close_my_account|help page on disabling your account]]. To confirm and disable your account, please fill out the form below.",

Once you have read that help page and are positive on the spelling of your new username, please submit a request below. Once your username is changed, you will receive a confirmation email. You can then log in with your new user name using your old password.

Your user talk page is found by following the \"my talk\" link at the top right of any page.

However, if this talk page option is not available in your situation, then the best advice we can give you is to wait the block out or join the community at another of the many thousand Wikia wikis available.

	'specialcontact-intro-features' => "Wikia offers many features, the majority of which are live on all wikis across the site by default.

If you are an admin and feel that specific feature is not working well for your wiki, please discuss with your wiki's community if they would also like the feature turned off.

If the feature is not list there, please [[Special:Contact/general|contact us]] with your request.

Admins interested in testing out new features that are still in development can check out the Labs section of [[Special:WikiFeatures|Wiki Features]].

    'specialcontact-intro-close-wiki' => "Thanks for contacting Wikia. We don't usually delete wikis once they have been created. Wikis are community-owned projects, and a wiki you are no longer interested in can wait for someone else to come along and [[Special:Contact/adoption|adopt it]].

If you wish to rename your wiki or \"start-over\" please first consult [[Help:Rename]] for renaming pages, and [[Help:Theme designer]] for renaming the title of your wiki. Wikis can easily have their names changed, without the hassle of starting over. If you wish to change your wiki's URL [[Special:Contact/general|please write to us]] as we'd be more than happy to do so for you.

If you feel this wiki is on a topic that no other users may be interested in (such as a personal or spam wiki), please submit a request using the form below. Please make the request from the wiki that needs closing.

I hope you find another wiki among the many that are part of Wikia, and join in building a fantastic resource about everything you are passionate about.
