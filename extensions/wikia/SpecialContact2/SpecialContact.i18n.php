Quando si esegue il test di sicurezza, è necessario:

* Non compromettere la disponibilità del sito
* Non compromettere la sicurezza o la privacy dei dati degli altri utenti
* Non essere invadenti o distruttivi

Quando segnali un problema di sicurezza, sei pregato di fornire tutti i dettagli del problema, tra cui:

* La procedura completa per riprodurre la vulnerabilità (compreso un URL di Proof-of-Concept, se appropriato)
* Indicare se hai eseguito l'accesso o sei disconnesso quando si verifica il problema
* Informazioni sul tuo browser, tra cui il tipo e la versione
** In particolare per XSS o vulnerabilità che richiedono un browser specifico o plugin per la riproduzione
* Una breve descrizione dell'impatto potenziale sulla sicurezza della vulnerabilità riscontrata

In risposta ai report di sicurezza che utilizzano questo modulo, FANDOM:
* Darà la priorità alla riproduzione e conferma di ogni vulnerabilità segnalata
* Identificherà una tempistica ragionevole per correggere le vulnerabilità confermate
* Non intraprenderà un'azione legale contro l'autore della segnalazione che ha agito in conformità a tutte le linee guida per il testing e la segnalazione di problemi di sicurezza",

Każda wiki to projekt należący do społeczności, więc jeżeli nie jesteś nią już zainteresowany, pamiętaj, że może poczekać aż znajdzie się użytkownik, który [[Special:Contact/adoption|ją przygarnie]].

Jeżeli chcesz zmienić nazwę wiki, poprawić literówkę albo błąd, zajrzyj najpierw na strony pomocy na temat [[w:pl:Przenoszenie stron|zmieniania nazw stron]] i [[w:pl:Pomoc:Kreator_motywu|kreatora motywu]]. Nazwę wiki oraz adres URL można bez przeszkód zmienić, nie ma potrzeby zaczynania wszystkiego od początku – wystarczy, że [[Special:Contact/general|do nas napiszesz]], nie musisz usuwać swojej wiki.

Jeżeli uważasz, że temat tej wiki nie zainteresuje nikogo innego (np. to twój prywatny projekt), wyślij wniosek o zamknięcie wiki używając poniższego formularza. Pamiętaj, żeby zrobić to z poziomu wiki, którą chcesz zamknąć.

Mamy nadzieję, że spośród tysięcy wiki składający się na FANDOM znajdziesz coś dla siebie i zajmiesz się innym pasjonującym projektem.
