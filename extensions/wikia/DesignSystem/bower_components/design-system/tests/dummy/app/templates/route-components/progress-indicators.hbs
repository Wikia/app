<h1>Progress indicators</h1>
<p>
	Inform the user that an operation is in progress, to reassure that the system is not hung or waiting for user input,
	and often to provide the user with an estimate of how far through a task the system has progressed.

	<p>
		A loading spinner is used best for short processes or when total time of completion is unknown.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <code>wds-spinner</code> class should be used in conjunction with <code>wds-spinner__stroke</code>
		and applied to an SVG with a circle. The properties of the SVG have to be either calculated beforehand
		or via JavaScript code.
	</p>
	{{#component-demo name='progress-indicator-intro' codeOnly=true}}
		<!--size = full diameter = r * 2 + stroke width-->
		{{wds-spinner active=true radius=38 strokeWidth=2 isBlock=true}}
	{{/component-demo}}
	<div>
		In addition to <code>wds-spinner</code> and <code>wds-spinner__stroke</code>, other classes can be used,
		to modify spinner's appearance:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<code>wds-spinner__block</code>, will make the spinner be displayed as a block
				- useful if you intent to use the spinner as a list element,
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>wds-spinner__overlay</code>, will cause the spinner to display a translucent
				white background and position it fixed in the center.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p>
		If you plan to have spinners of various sizes it's best to calculate those via <i>JavaScript</i>.
		Until interactions are implemented in Design System that code will need to be duplicated over applications.
		You can see the reference code in <code>wds-spinner</code> Ember component.
	</p>
	{{#component-demo name='progress-indicator'}}
		{{wds-spinner
			active=true
			isBlock=true
			overlay=false
			radius=20
			strokeWidth=5
		}}
	{{/component-demo}}

	<p>
		To modify its size you can specify <code>radius</code> and to modify how thick it is you can specify
		<code>stroke width</code>.
		All other attributes (like radius and stroke length) will be calculated based on those two.
	</p>
