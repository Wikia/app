/**
 * @author: Sean Colombo
 *
 * This script will serve up CSS that has been created generated by SASS.
 * The script is responsible for verifying the cryptographic signature,
 * for preventing deadlock from similar requests, for piping colors from the
 * query-string into the .scss files, and for using memcache to speed up responses.
 *
 * NOTE: While SASS can output to standard out, that only happens if now output file
 * is specified.  Since we are using additional command line params, those params end up
 * being used as the output filename if we don't provide one, so for now we are stuck with
 * a tmp file.
 * An alternative would be to write a daemon in Ruby (instead of this PHP script) which would
 * use Sass as a module rather than via the command-line... but that comes with its own set
 * of problems (performance concerns of having a single daemon instead of process-per-request as
 * well as having the challenge of not having the MediaWiki stack available for connecting to the
 * right memcached, etc.).
 *
 * Expected URL params:
 * - "file" (the full filename of the .scss file to parse - eg: "skins/oasis/css/oasis.scss")
 * - "styleVersion" (the wgStyleVersion at the time the calling-code was generated)
 * - "hash" (a cryptographic signature generated by the SassUtil::getSecurityHash() function)
