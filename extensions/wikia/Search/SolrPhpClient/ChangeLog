	* Apache/Solr/Service.php, Apache/Solr/Service/Balancer.php: See
	  http://code.google.com/p/solr-php-client/issues/detail?id=1
	  
	  Changed require_once statements that expected the Solr Client
	  library to be on the include path into statements that use the
	  __FILE__ magic constant to do them as absolute paths. This should
	  get rid of the requirement for the user to change their include
	  path configuration or add the library to the include path at
	  runtime.
	  
	  Provided as a convenience for the user.
