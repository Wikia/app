Before contributing to the {{SITENAME}} Forums, please keep in mind a few best practices for conduct:

'''Be nice and treat people with respect.'''
: People from all around the world read and edit this wiki and its forums. Like any other collaborative project, not everyone will agree all the time. Keep discussions civil and be open minded about differing opinions. We're all here because we love the same topic.

'''Try to find existing discussions first, but don't be afraid to start a new thread.'''
:Please take a moment to sift through the {{SITENAME}} Forum boards to see if a discussion already exists about something you want to talk about. If you can't find what you're looking for, jump right in and start a new discussion!

'''Ask for help.'''
:Notice something that doesn't seem right? Or do you have a question? Ask for help here on the forums! If you need help from Fandom staff, please reach out on [[w:c:community|Community Central]] or via [[Special:Contact]].

'''Have fun!'''
:The {{SITENAME}} community is happy to have you here. We look forward to seeing you around as we discuss this topic we all love.

==Forum FAQ==
'''How do I stay on top of discussions I'm interested in?'''
: With a Fandom user account, you can follow specific conversations and then receive notification messages (either on-site or via email) when a discussion has more activity. Be sure to [[Special:UserSignup|sign up for a Fandom account]] if you don't already have one.

'''How do I remove vandalism?'''
: If you notice some spam or vandalism on a thread, hover your mouse over the offending text. You'll see a \"More\" button appear. Inside the \"More\" menu, you'll find \"Remove\". This will allow you to remove the vandalism and optionally inform an admin.

'''What are Kudos?'''
: If you find a particular discussion or reply interesting, well thought out, or amusing you can show direct appreciation by giving it Kudos. They can be helpful in voting situations, too.

'''What are Topics?'''
: Topics allow you to link a forum discussion with a wiki article. It's another way to keep Forums organized and to help people find interesting discussions. For example, a Forum thread tagged with \"Lord Voldemort\" will appear at the bottom of the \"Lord Voldemort\" article.",
