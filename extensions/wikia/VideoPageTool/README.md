# VideoPageTool

## Front-end Assets & Installation
This extension integrates BackboneJS (using Lodash as an UnderscoreJS replacement). This extension also introduces streamlined guidelines for naming of AMD modules. Front-end assets are managed using Bower and are also included in the repo. Please update lib files through `bower`.

## File Naming Conventions
Items that are only used for the user-facing side are labeled "VideoHomePage".  Items that are only used for the admin side are labeled "VideoPageAdmin".  Shared items are labeled "VideoPageTool" or "shared".
