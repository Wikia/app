
Wikia Editor Introduction
=========================

Editor is an event-driven platform which is designed to have all features implemented as plugins.
The main editor object does not handle anything more than being able to bootstrap plugins
and allow message and data exchange between plugins (+ logging capabilities, which might have
been done as a separate plugin too).


Bootstrapping editor instance
=============================

How to create new editor instance?
----------------------------------

Editor needs the plugins list which are to be loaded and a configuration data. Both are passed
as arguments to the editor class constructor. Each plugin may use any configuration data to
adjust its behavior.

	window.WikiaEditor.create(plugins,config)

The logic for creating the plugins list and configuration data is often so big that
a class can be created to perform the whole process. Working examples are in directory:

	js/loaders/*

Editor pre-initialization events
--------------------------------

These events are the only ones which are not called in the editor instance context.

GlobalTriggers :: wikiaeditoraddons ( WikiaEditor_namespace )
	- run once per page while initializing the first instance of editor
	- good place to define new plugins etc

WikiaEditor :: newInstance ( plugins, config )
	- run once for each editor created
	- allows other extensions or entities to modify the plugins list or configuration
		just before the editor instance is created


Editor initialization work-flow
-------------------------------

Staged initialization:

* initConfig( editor )
	- config overrides by plugins should happen here
* beforeInit( editor )
	- plugins should bind to events, expose theirs public interfaces
* init( editor )
	- the actual initialization should happen here
* initEditor( editor, editorElement )
	- editor DOM should be created here
* initDom( editor )
	- other DOM related things should be initialized here

Asynchronous initialization events (components ready reports):

* uiReady( editor )
	- UI is ready now and you are able to create UI elements too
		(will not be called before initDom initialization)
* editorReady( editor )
	- editor is ready
* editboxReady( editor, editbox )
	- editor editbox is ready

Standard editor events
----------------------

* state( editor, state )
	- editor internal state has just changed
* mode( editor, mode )
	- editor mode has just been switched
* editorFocus( editor )
	- editor has just gained focus
* editorBlur( editor )
	- editor has just lost focus
* bodyClick( event, bodyElement )
	- click event bubbled up to body element
* uiBuildClickHandler( editor, elementConfig )
	- UI element without click handler is registering and is being autobuilt now
* uiFetchDefaults( editor, elements )
	- fired just before adding the default list of UI elements defined in configuration
		(it's possible to add and remove entries)
* uiAddExternalProvider( editor, externalProvider )
	- UI elements external provider has just been added
* uiExternalProviderReady( editor )
	- UI elements external provider has been initialized
* uiAddHandler( editor, type, handler )
	- new UI element type handler (renderer) has just been registered
* uiAddElement( editor, name, definition )
	- new UI element definition has just been added
* uiStandardElementCreated( editor, elementDefinition, data )
	- new UI element has just been rendered into HTML
* toolbarsRendered( editor )
	- toolbar spaces has just been filled in according to their configuration
* toolbarsResized( editor )
	- toolbar size might have been changed


Plugin architecture
-------------------

The following method names are *magic-like*: initConfig, beforeInit, init, initEditor, initDom
and gets run automatically during the corresponding initalization phase of the editor.

The "editor" property keeps the reference to the parent editor object.

Plugins may be added to the editor *statically* (as an item in the plugins list or one of their
dependency) or *dynamically* (added by call to initPlugin() of the editor object).

The *dynamic* initialization has the following differences:
- the plugin skips already passed initialization phases (e.g. initConfig, beforeInit is not called
  when the editor is in "init" initialization phase

 Wikiacore plugin contains list of plugins to be loaded.


Modules architecture
