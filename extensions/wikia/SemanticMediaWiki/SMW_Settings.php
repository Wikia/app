#    CHANGING THE CONFIGURATION FOR SEMANTIC MEDIAWIKI          #

###
# Configure SPARQL database connection for Semantic MediaWiki. This is used
# when SPARQL-based features are enabled, e.g. when using SMWSparqlStore as
# the $smwgDefaultStore.
#
# The default class SMWSparqlDatabase works with many databases that support
# SPARQL and SPARQL Update. Three different endpoints (service URLs) are given
# for query (reading queries like SELECT), update (SPARQL Update queries), and
# data (SPARQL HTTP Protocol for Graph Management). The query endpoint is
# necessary, but the update and data endpoints can be omitted if not supported.
# This will lead to reduced functionality (e.g. the SMWSparqlStore will not
# work if Update is not available). The data endpoint is always optional, but
# in some SPARQL databases this method is more efficient than update.
#
# The default graph is similar to a database name in relational databases. It
# can be set to any URI (e.g. the main page uri of your wiki with
# "#graph" appended). Leaving the default graph URI empty only works if the
# store is configure to use some default default graph or if it generally
# supports this. Different wikis should normally use different default graphs
# unless there is a good reason to share one graph.

# enabled, this may lead to PHP crashes (!) when very long texts are used as
# values. This is due to limitations in the library PCRE that PHP uses for
# pattern matching. The provoked PHP crashes will prevent requests from being

# (1) Concept queries that would not be allowed as normal queries will not be
# executed directly, but can use pre-computed results instead. This is the
# default.
# (2) The whole Concept: namespace can be restricted (using some suitable
# MediaWiki extension) to an experienced user group that may create more
# complex queries responably. Other users can employ thus defined concepts in
# their queries.
