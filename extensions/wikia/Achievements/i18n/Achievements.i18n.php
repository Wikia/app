It works best when your picture is square, and when the most important part of the picture is right in the middle.<br /><br />You can use rectangular pictures, but you might find that a bit gets cropped out by the frame. If you have a graphics program, then you can crop your picture to put the important part of the image in the center. If you don\'t, then just experiment with different pictures until you find the ones that work for you! If you don\'t like the picture that you\'ve chosen, click "Revert to default" to go back to the original graphic.<br /><br />You can also give the badges new names that reflect the topic of the wiki. When you\'ve changed badge names, click "Save changes" to save what you\'ve done. Have fun!',
