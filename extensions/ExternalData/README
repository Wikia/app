== Overview ==

External Data is an extension to MediaWiki that allows for retrieving data
from various sources: external URLs and local wiki pages (in CSV, JSON and
XML formats), database tables, and LDAP servers

The extension defines five parser functions - #get_external_data,
#get_db_data, #get_ldap_data, #external_value and #for_external_table:

#get_external_data retrieves the data from a URL that holds XML, CSV or
JSON, and assigns it to local variables or arrays.

#get_db_data retrieves data from a database, using a SQL query, and assigns
it to local variables or arrays.

#get_ldap_data retrieves data from an LDAP server and assigns it to
local variables.

#external_value displays the value of any retrieved variable, or the
first value if it's an array.

#for_external_table applies processing onto multiple rows retrieved by
#get_external_data.

In addition, the extension defines a new special page, 'GetData', that
exports selected rows from a wiki page that holds CSV data, in a format that
is readable by #get_external_data.

== Requirements ==

This version of the External Data extension requires MediaWiki 1.8 or higher.

== Installation ==

To install the extension, place the entire 'ExternalData' directory
within your MediaWiki 'extensions' directory, then add the following
line to your 'LocalSettings.php' file:

     require_once( "$IP/extensions/ExternalData/ExternalData.php" );

To cache the data from the URLs being accessed, you can call the contents
of ExternalData.sql in your database, then add the following to
LocalSettings.php:

     $edgCacheTable = 'ed_url_cache';

You should also add a line like the following, to set the expiration time
of the cache, in seconds; this line will cache data for a week:

     $edgCacheExpireTime = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60; 

You can also set for string replacements to be done on the URLs you call,
for instance to hide API keys:

     $edgStringReplacements['MY_API_KEY'] = 'abcd1324';

You can create a "whitelist" to allow retrieval of data only from trusted
sites, in the manner of MediaWiki's $wgAllowExternalImagesFrom - if you
are hiding API keys, it is very much recommended to create such a
whitelist, to prevent users from being able to discover theire values:

     $edgAllowExternalDataFrom = array('http://example.com/api');

Finally, to use the database or LDAP retrieval capabilities, you need to
set connection settings as well - see the online documentation for more
information.
