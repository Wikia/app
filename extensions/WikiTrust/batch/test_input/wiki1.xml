A computer cluster is a group of loosely coupled [[computer]]s that work together closely so that in many respects they can be viewed as though they are a single computer.  The components of a cluster are commonly, but not always, connected to each other through fast [[local area network]]s.  Clusters are usually deployed to improve performance and/or availability over that provided by a single computer, while typically being much more cost-effective than single computers of comparable speed or availability.

==Cluster categorizations==
===High-availability (HA) clusters===
[[High-availability cluster]]s (a.k.a Failover clusters) are implemented primarily for the purpose of improving the availability of services which the cluster provides.  They operate by having redundant [[Node (networking)|nodes]], which are then used to provide service when system components fail.  The most common size for an HA cluster is two nodes, which is the minimum requirement to provide redundancy.   HA cluster implementations attempt to manage the redundancy inherent in a cluster to eliminate single points of failure. There are many commercial implementations of High-Availability clusters for many operating systems.   The [[Linux-HA]] project is one commonly used [[free software]] HA package for the [[Linux]] OS.

===Load-balancing clusters===
[[Load balancing (computing)|Load-balancing]] clusters operate by having all workload come through one or more load-balancing front ends, which then distribute it to a collection of back end servers.  Although they are primarily implemented for improved performance, they commonly include high-availability features as well.  Such a cluster of computers is sometimes referred to as a [[server farm]].  There are many commercial load balancers available including  Platform LSF HPC, [[Sun Grid Engine]], [[Moab Cluster Suite]] and [[Maui Cluster Scheduler]].  The [[Linux Virtual Server]] project provides one commonly used free software package for the Linux OS. 

===High-performance (HPC) clusters===
High-performance clusters are implemented primarily to provide increased performance by splitting a computational task across many different [[Node (networking)|nodes]] in the cluster, and are most commonly used in scientific computing. One of the most popular HPC implementations is a cluster with nodes running [[Linux]] as the [[Operating system|OS]] and free software to implement the parallelism. This configuration is often referred to as a [[Beowulf (computing)|Beowulf]] cluster. Such clusters commonly run custom programs which have been designed to exploit the parallelism available on HPC clusters. Many such programs use libraries such as [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]] which are specially designed for writing scientific applications for HPC computers.

HPC clusters are optimized for workloads which require jobs or processes happening on the separate cluster computer nodes to communicate actively during the computation.  These include computations where intermediate results from one node's calculations will affect future calculations on other nodes.
