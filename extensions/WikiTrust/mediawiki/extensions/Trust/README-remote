Instructions for running WikiTrust as a remote process on another
server.

It may be the case that you want to run WikiTrust split across
multiple servers, where the base MW instalation lives on a web server,
while the processing happens on one or more compute servers.

MediwWiki Setup:

Install the MW extenion as before, but instead of this line in
LocalSettings.php,

require_once( $IP . "/extensions/Trust/Trust.php" );

Use this line:

require_once( $IP . "/extensions/Trust/RemoteTrust.php" );

Also, add this variable to LocalSettings.php:
$wgContentServerURL = "http://localhost:4444/?";

This specifies the server and port to query when requesting colored
markup. Note the presence of the final "?" charactor in the url.

Next, because RemoteTrust uses the Gadgets extenion
(http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Gadgets), you first need to
install this extension. Gadgest allows indevedual users to turn
WikiTrust on and off.

Lastly, add this line

* WikiTrust|wikitrust.js

To the page MediaWiki:Gadgets-definition.

This installs WikiTrust as a Gadget.

Server Setup.

Currently remote WikiTrust is self contained.

All that is required is the same pattern of 

$ make all 
or 
$ make allopt

Launch the server process with ./analysis/server, and the processing
program with ./analysis/dispatcher.
