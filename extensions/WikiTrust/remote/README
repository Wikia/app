Remote wiki processing.

The code in this directory (/remote) is desinged to allow the
processing of wiki reputation on a different server and/or network
than the MediaWiki servers which host the actual wiki.

====Directory Structure====

analysis/

This directory contains the ocaml source code which does the wiki
processing.
It also has a mod_python implementation for communicating with the
MediaWiki server.

It has the following source files:

* server.py

A mod_python web-server, it returns colored markup on request. It also
records votes.

* server.ml

A depricated implementation of the wikitrust server. It is a
standalone server, and does not require Apache. 

* server_coloring_dispatcher.ml 

This is the top-level file for processing wikitext and votes.

* tmpfile.ml

Very basic code which create a unique temp file.

* wikipedia_api.ml

A library which communicated with a mediawiki api. It also talks to a
user-id mapping program, currently running on the toolserver.

* mediawiki/extensions/Trust/

All of the PHP code for the revised remote trust extension.

===Setup===

On Ubuntu,

apt-get install libapache2-mod-python

Link or copy server.py to an Apache directory.
Enable mod_python for this site with 

SetHandler python-program
PythonHandler server
# Turn of for production
PythonDebug On
# adjust for your installation.
PythonPath "['/var/www/wikis/coloring'] + sys.path"

Replace /var/www/wikis/coloring with the path to your server.py

Test that everything is working by going to 
http://192.168.135.130:10302/

(replace 192.168.135.130:10302 with your ip address and port).

You should see the text "bad".

Now, you need to install these ocaml packages:
netsys,netclient,camlzip

apt-get install libzip-ocaml-dev

For netsys and netclient however, it is needed to install from source
(this one source tarball does both packages):

wget http://download.camlcity.org/download/ocamlnet-2.2.9.tar.gz
tar -zxf ocamlnet-2.2.9.tar.gz
cd ocamlnet-2.2.9/
./configure -with-nethttpd
make all
make opt
make install

Now, try compiling the ocaml files.

make all
make allopt

At this point, the following binay programs should be created:

server -- Depricated in faivor of server.py
dispatcher -- Actually processes edits and votes

Remote Trust requires a seperate MediaWiki type database in which to
run. The easiest way to get this is to set up a dumy MW instalation,
using the web-based form to create the initial db,
and then run the sql/create_db.php script. The arguments for this are:
sql/create_db.php path_to_mw_instalation db_root_user_name [remove]

Now, setup the php component.

In your mediawiki instalation, link the following files into
wikitrust/mediawiki/extensions/Trust:

RemoteTrust.i18n.php -> ../../../remote/mediawiki/extensions/Trust/RemoteTrust.i18n.php
RemoteTrustImpl.php -> ../../../remote/mediawiki/extensions/Trust/RemoteTrustImpl.php
RemoteTrust.php -> ../../../remote/mediawiki/extensions/Trust/RemoteTrust.php
RemoteTrustUpdate.php -> ../../../remote/mediawiki/extensions/Trust/RemoteTrustUpdate.php

Update LocalSettings.php, replacing ``all" old trust values with these values:

# Trust extension
$wgUseTidy = true;
$wgUseAjax = true;
$wgShowVoteButton = true; // If true, the vote button is shown.
$wgTrustCmd = $IP . "/eval_online_wiki"; 
$wgTrustLog = "/tmp/{$wgDBname}-trust.log";
$wgTrustDebugLog = "/tmp/{$wgDBname}-trust-debug.log";
$wgRepSpeed = 1.0;
$wgContentServerURL = "http://localhost:10302/?";

require_once( $IP . "/extensions/Gadgets/Gadgets.php" );
require_once( $IP . "/extensions/Trust/RemoteTrust.php" );

Update wgContentServerURL to point to the web server you set up for
mod_python earlier.

Lastly, add the Gadgets widget to your installation. Instructions are
provided here:
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Gadgets

Configure WikiTrust to run via Gadgets.
Go here:
http://192.168.135.130/testwiki/index.php/MediaWiki:Gadgets-definition

And set the text to be:
* WikiTrust|wikitrust.js

You must be logged in as the WikiSysop admin user to do this.

Now, log in as a regular user. Click on "my preferences", "Gadgets".
Check the box for WikiTrust.

===Running===

You are now ready to try running the system.
Click on a check-trust tab. You should get a message stating that
trust for this page is not availible.

Laucnch the dispatcher program to color the requested page.
In remote/analysis, do:

./dispatcher --help 

This shows all of the availible options.

For general purpose, do:

./dispatcher -db_user wikiuser -db_name wikidb -db_pass password
-db_host localhost -db_port 3306 -wiki_api
http://192.168.135.130/testwiki/api.php -user_id_api
http://toolserver.org/~Ipye/UserName2UserId.php

Update -wiki_api to point to the api.php page you want to target for
requests for wiki-text. -user_id_api is a small program which returns
the Wikipedia UserID for a username, because it is not exposed via the
API currently.

Run this in the forground for debugging, and in general as a deamon process.

It prints out information about the edits and votes processed.
With dispatcher running, the wikitrust extension should work exactly
as before.
