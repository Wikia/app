The GIS extension is based on the experience learned from WikiProject 
Geographical coordinates. The extensions can be enabled individually, but
the concept is certainly more powerful when they are all enabled.

Magnus Manske has been extremely helpful in the work on integration with 
Wikimaps, and that work will continue. I would also like to give a big thank
you to all participants in WikiProject Geographical coordinates who have
helped immensely with suggestions practical work.

Installation

   The gis extension is compatible with both version 1.9 of
   MediaWiki.

   The extension can be found under extensions/gis in the MediaWiki CVS
   repository. After having checked out from CVS, move the extensions/gis
   directory to the $mediawiki/extensions directory and add these lines
   to LocalSettings.php:

   $wgMapsourcesURL = "extensions/gis/index.php";
   include( "extensions/gis/geo.php" );

   If the $wgMapsourcesURL definition is omitted, the geo tag will not
   include a link to the map sources.

   If inclusion of database.php is omitted, there will be no database, so
   the neighborhood and map support functions are disabled.

   If using the database function, the gis database must be enabled. This
   may be done via the [1]phpMyAdmin database maintenance tool, running
   gisdb.sql. Remember to replace /*$wgDBprefix*/ with your actual
   prefix. It can also be done directly in MySQL:

   # mysql -u USERNAME -p -D wikidb
   source extensions/gis/gisdb.sql;
   quit;

   If the map sources are used, a suitable map source file should be
   installed in Wiki:Map sources (or equivalent). You can use the [2]map
   source example as a starting point.
