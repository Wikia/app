Implementation notes...
-----------------------

== Goals ==

As a reminder, some things we are and aren't trying to accomplish here:

=== Are trying to achieve: ===

* All new accounts will be valid on all Wikimedia wikis, using a consistent
  username and password everywhere.

* Once migrated, all old accounts will be valid on all Wikimedia wikis,
  using a consistent username and password everywhere.

* Accounts will only have to set and confirm e-mail in one place.

=== Are not trying to achieve at this time: ===

* Automatic passing of login data between sites
* Integration with non-Wikimedia authentication systems (OpenID etc)
* Total integration of user options, etc across wikis

=== Are not trying to achieve ever: ===

* Different usernames on each wiki


== Migration strategies ==

The system consists of 'local' accounts (the user table entries on each wiki)
and 'global' accounts (the accounts on the central auth server).

A local account may be in one of two states:
 - unattached: old account awaiting migration
 - attached: migrated, or newly created under the new system

An attempt to login with a given name on a given wiki will encounter one of
these possible states:
 - no global account: 'no such user' error
 - no local account: an attached local account will be transparently created
 - attached: login continues
 - unattached: login-time migration will be triggered


=== First-stage migration ===

This is an automated process which will run when the system is put into
place:

For each name in use on the various wikis at initial migration time, a
global account is created.

One account for each name is selected as the 'winner', usually the most
prolific. The winner's password and email address are assigned to the
global account.

Some accounts can be fully migrated automatically:
 - Name occurred only on one wiki
 - Multiple instances, but all with the same e-mail address
 - Potentially, unused accounts could be subsumed automatically

Note that passwords cannot be checked at this time due to the hashing
method used in our user table. Matching e-mail addresses can be considered
'password-equivalent' here as whoever owns that address is able to set
the password.

If there are accounts which do not match the winning e-mail address, the
account will be left in a transitional state:
 - Matching local accounts are attached, and can be used to log in.
 - Non-matching local accounts are left unattached, for later migration.


=== Login-time migration ===

When a user attempts to login to an unattached account, this triggers
login-time migration.

The account can now be automatically attached if:
 - The given password matches both the local and global account
 - The local account's email address matches the global account's
   confirmed e-mail address

(We check e-mail again as the global account's email may have been changed
since original migration time.)


=== Login-time renaming ===

Some portion of name conflicts really are different people, so they won't
be able to confirm themselves as the global account owner.

If the login-time migration checks fail, the user is offered the option to
rename the account, either merging it to an existing global account or making
a brand new one.

* FIXME: We may need to clean up some rename operations to make this safe.


=== Cleanup and long-term ===

The presence of a third-party unattached local account on a given wiki means
that the owner of the global account can't use his/her global account to log
in on that wiki.

Practically speaking, not all conflicting accounts will be resolved by their
owners in a timely fashion. Some will never return; some will be malicious;
some will just forget.

We'll require a way for unclaimed unattached accounts to be renamed forcefully.
Possibly this can require a bureaucrat's intervention; possibly this can be
done by the conflicting global account's owner after some timeout period.


=== Notifications ===

Conflicting accounts should be notified by e-mail where possible.


== Implementation: parts! ==

* Core: central database o' fun
* Edge: Wikis

=== Communication requirements ===

* Full edge<->core connectivity in cases:
 - pmtpa: same database cluster
 - pmtpa.enwiki: alternate database master
 - yaseo: offsite [could be implemented with a ssh tunnel to mysql]

* Open login sessions should continue to function if core is offline

* (?) Previously used login sessions should be able to log back in if
      core is offline.

If core is inaccessible from an edge server:

* Open login sessions should continue to basically function
 - some operations such as changing password or email would fail

* Previously used logins _may_ be able to log back in
 - using previously stored password hash? Unsure about this.

* New account creations, etc obviously would fail



=== Core auth API ===

A few basic operations:

* register($name)
* setPassword($name, $hashedPass)
* setEmail($name, $email)
* setEmailConfirmed($name)
* attachLocal($name, $dbname)
* attemptAuth($name, $hashedPass)



=== Some crappy login pseudocode ===

On login:
* load local account data
  if local user exists:
    * coreAuth::attemptAuth($name, $hashedPass)
      if passed:
        -> update local lock state, email, email confirmation
        -> successful login.
      else if failed:
        -> whine about bad pass
      else if no such user:
        -> INVALID STATE
  else:
    * coreAuth::attemptAuth($name, $hashedPass)
      if passed:
        -> create local account
        -> coreAuth::attachLocal($name, $dbname)
        -> update local lock state, email, email confirmation
        -> successful login.
      else if failed:
        -> whine about bad pass
      else if no such user:
        -> whine about no such user

On registration request:
* load local account data
  if local user exists:
    -> whine about user already exists
  else:
    * coreAuth::attemptAuth($name, $hashedPass)
      if passed:
        -> whine or log in :)
      else if failed:
        -> whine about user already exists
      else if no such user:
        -> coreAuth::register($name)
        -> coreAuth::setEmail($name, $email)
        -> coreAuth::setPassword($name, $hashedPass)
        -> create local account
        -> coreAuth::attachLocal($name, $dbname)
        -> update local lock state, email, email confirmation
        -> successful login.

  - registration.dia

== Edge implementation ==

The AuthPlugin interface was written with the idea of creating local accounts
automatically on login based on external data.

Probably require some additional work on the login page to work in migration.

Users logged in to a transitional account should see a notice about the
remaining unattached accounts. (This could be dismissed eg to show only
on the preferences page to minimize annoyance.) From this notice a list
of conflicting wikis can be produced for immediate link-and-login.


== Core implementation ==

Either this can be done as local PHP code accessing a database (potentially
via ssh tunnel for yaseo) or hit something over http/https. May want to
examine this a bit.


== Migration testing ==

First-stage migration can be tested offline to get some statistics.


== Messages and translations ==

Get the UI messages ready with some time before this goes live; we'll want
translations in the various languages ready to go.


== Permissions ==

Group memberships (hence on-wiki permissions) remain local; a sysop in
one place is not necessarily in another.

We will have to make some changes to the way we handle the restricted
wikis however: the simplest thing would be to add a group on those wikis
for approved users, and shift the permissions over from 'user' to 'private'
or whatever. Then add some handy way for local sysops to privatise people,
rather than the cumbersome 'account by email'.
