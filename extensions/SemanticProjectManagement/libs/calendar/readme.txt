Thank you for downloading Tigra Calendar! We appreciate your interest
and we hope that you'll enjoy working with the component.


GETTING STARTED
----------------------------------------------

Tigra Calendar is a JavaScript software component, it is not intended
for stand-alone use. We included several working samples demonstrating
component's features and possible use scenarios, but eventually the
calendar must be configured inside your own web pages. Follow the
steps below to implement the calendar in your application:

1. Test the samples, make sure calendar works in all the required browsers
2. Make a copy of one of the samples and customize the calendar's
   configuration for your needs. Check the page after every modification.
3. Copy calendar related code from the test page into the destination
   page. Adjust paths if needed.
