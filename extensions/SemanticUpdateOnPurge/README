== About ==

'SemanticUpdateOnPurge' is a 'Semantic MediaWiki' [0] extension by Daniel Werner. It updates Semantic MediaWikis
properties of an article whenever the article is purged.
SMW standard behavior is to update properties only on page save (as of SMW 1.6)


== Installation ==

Once you have downloaded the code, place the 'SemanticUpdateOnPurge' directory within your MediaWiki 'extensions'
directory. Then add the following code to your [[Manual:LocalSettings.php|LocalSettings.php]] file:

 # SemanticUpdateOnPurge
 require_once( "$IP/extensions/SemanticUpdateOnPurge/SemanticUpdateOnPurge.php" );


== Compatibility ==

Versions 0.2.1 to 0.4 are tested on SMW 1.6.1 and 1.6.2 (propably working with 1.6 too) There have been some issues
with some versions of the SMW 1.5.x branch, where in early versions the extension seemed to work, then it didn't.


== Contributing ==
