== Disclaimer ==

Semantic Drilldown is a new extension, and there is no
guarantee that any of it will work on your system. However, it does
not make any modifications to the database, so it should be a
low-risk installation.

For a proper legal disclaimer, see the file "COPYING".

== Requirements ==

The extension requires an install of Semantic MediaWiki 0.6 or
greater. For more details, see Semantic MediaWiki's own
installation requirements.

== Installation ==

(1) Extract the archive to obtain the directory "SemanticCalendar"
    that contains all relevant files. Copy this directory (or
    extract/download it) to "[wikipath]/extensions/".
(2) Insert the following line into the file "[wikipath]/LocalSettings.php":
      include_once('extensions/SemanticCalendar/includes/SC_Settings.php');
