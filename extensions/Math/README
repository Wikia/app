This version (for MediaWiki 1.19) has some changes since previous versions:

* rendering options have been reduced to just 'Always PNG' and 'Leave it as TeX'
** all other rendering options will merge to PNG.
* initial experimental support for integrating MathJax client-side rendering

See the README in the math subdirectory for more info on setting up the
low-level conversion tools.
