SubstAll is an extension written for MediaWiki. Only tested on the
current trunk (1.14alpha), but should function on anything as far
back as 1.11. To install, do the following:

1. Download copy SubstAll.php and SubstAll.i18n.php to a
   subfolder of your extensions directory.
2. Add require_once("extensions/SubstAll/SubstAll.php"); to
   your LocalSettings.php file.

The syntax is simple. Anything placed within <substall>...</substall>
tags on page save will be preprocessed to final wiki markup. This
means all templates, all magic words, et cetera will be full expanded.
This is similar to the behavior of the ExpandTemplates extension
written by Tim Starling.

The word "substall" can be customized by editing the "substall-hook"
message on your MediaWiki (navigate to [[MediaWiki:Substall-hook]]
and replace it with any single word you'd like).

Also, setting $wgRemoveCommentsOnSubstAll to true (default) will strip
any HTML comments <!-- like this --> from the output. Set to false if
you'd like to have them instead.

Software is free under GNU GPL v2 or a later version if you'd wish. Enjoy.
