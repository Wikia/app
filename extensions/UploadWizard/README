UploadWizard is an extension for MediaWiki, which adds a more user-friendly wizard for uploading media files.

Although developed with Wikimedia Commons in mind, it should be useful for other users of MediaWiki as well. 
However it has not been tested extensively with non-Wikimedia installations of MediaWiki. Your feedback will
help greatly.

UploadWizard is licensed under the same terms as MediaWiki itself.
