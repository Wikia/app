'[[Extension:DiscussionThreading|See formal extension description]]
== Release Notes ==
* 1.3 - Added Dan Brice's code that will automatically insert indentation (so comment body is appropriately indented) and patches for compatibility with MW Versions Prior to 1.11
* 1.2 - [[User:siebrand|siebrand]] updated to use current extension standards (THANKS!)
* 1.1 - Updated to be forward compatible with release 1.11, bug fix
** Rob Church made mods that simplifies, beautifies, etc. the hook which is included in the next release, needed to change extension to make consistent
** Fixed bug where I forgot to declare $wgSectionThreadingOn as a global in one subroutine - caused a php error to display
** Need to download both the patches and the extension - they must be updated as a set.
* 1.0 
** greatly reduces patching - completely dependent on hooks, although needs 2 hooks in linker.php to execute
** Added [new] link in section header that starts a new thread at the bottom
** Defaults to add new comment when discussion page first entered
** If previous patches applied, EditPage.php can be reverted to appropriate release version - patches no longer required
* Between Version 0.0 and 0.1, changed to use the name 'DiscussionThreading' instead of the 'AddCommentSection'.  The comment was vestigial and not fully descriptive.

== What can this extension do? ==

MediaWiki supports a discussion model called talk pages. These are regular wiki pages whose only distinction is that they are associated with a content page. That is, these two types of pages are always linked to each other, a content page and a talk page. Since talk pages are regular wiki pages, they suffer many usability shortcomings.  This extension addresses some of these shortcomings by customizing talk pages including:

* '''Minimal threading''' -  Subject headings are used to identify what discussion a particular comment belongs to. These headings are not dated and cannot be sorted.
* '''Users explicitly sign their comments''' - signatures are automatically added to the discussions. 
* '''Transparent response mechanism''' - users can reply to existing comments or create new ones using the [new][edit][reply]  
* '''Conversation tracking''' - the [reply] allows users to specify existing objects (sections) in the system, and effectively track comments one has left, responses received (regardless of the location), and so on. 

For a more complete analysis, check Erik Möller's [http://www.wikieducator.org/WikiEducator_roadmap/Improve_discussion_functionality article], from which the above was liberally plagiarized.

When a new post is created, the extension automatically tags with user information and posting date.  Much like a threaded discussion listserv, it allows response to individual posts and organizes.  Still allows user standard user editing.  Tags do not appear on article or other pages, limited to discussion and 're:' is automatically added to replies.

Once installed it can be enabled or disabled using the global variable below the inclusion (Enabled by default with the inclusion):
<pre>
$wgSectionThreadingOn = True;  /* Enabled */
</pre>

== Announcements ==
* Will be incorporating [[User:Danbrice|Danbrice's]] [[Extension_talk:DiscussionThreading#Re:_CSS_tip_to_make_reply_body_match_title.3F_--Danbrice_05:02.2C_29_July_2008_.28UTC.29|automatic indent revisions]] in as soon as I upgrade a server to 1.13 and can test it.
* Finally got around to putting into SVN and updated instructions
* '''GREAT NEWS!'''  The enhancement request [http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10139 Allow Developers to add links to edit sections via hooks] has been made.  This means no patches are required to install this extension if you are using REL1_11 or greater.

== Usage ==

Using Wikis for project management and collaboration.  Many of the older users were much more comfortable with the listserv approach.  This is a transitional path for them.

== Installation ==

Installation is straightforward for REL1_11 and greater because hooks were added in Linker.php that eliminated the need for patching.  However, if you are using a version below REL1_11, you will have to patch as described in the [[Extension:DiscussionThreading/doc#Installation_Instructions|installation instructions]].

See [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:DiscussionThreading/doc#DiscussionThreading_Extension_Download_and_Installation Installation Instructions]

== Parameters ==

== Changes to LocalSettings.php ==

<source lang="php">require_once("$IP/extensions/DiscussionThreading/DiscussionThreading.php");</source>

=== Code ===

Has been fairly comprehensively tested.  
Has the following hooks:

<pre>

	$wgHooks['EditPage::showEditForm:initial'][] =  'efDiscussionThread';
	$wgHooks['EditPage::attemptSave'][] = 'efStampReply';
	$wgHooks['EditPage::showEditForm:initial'][] =  'efDiscussionThreadEdit';
### custom created hooks in linker.php - no longer custom in release >1.11
	$wgHooks['editSectionLinkForOther'][] =  'efDiscussionLink4other';
	$wgHooks['editSectionLink'][] =  'efDiscussionLink';
###
	$wgHooks['AlternateEdit'][] =  'efDiscussionThreadEdit';
</pre>

Patches required to Linker.php in all versions up to 1.11 - after that version, no patching required

== Indenting Headers ==

If you are really serious about threading, you can indent headers by modifying the corresponding CSS file (eg. skins/monobook/main.css).  To modify all headers (talk or regular article), you can add a 'padding-left: <small>''x''</small>em;' into each of the headers 3-6.  Eg.:

h3 { font-size: 132%; padding-left: <span style="color: red">1em</span>;}<br>
h3 .editsection { font-size: 76%; font-weight: normal; }<br>
h4 { font-size: 116%; padding-left: <span style="color: red">2em</span>;}<br>
h4 .editsection { font-size: 86%; font-weight: normal; }<br>
h5 { font-size: 100%; padding-left: <span style="color: red">3em</span>;}<br>
h5 .editsection { font-weight: normal; }<br>
h6 { font-size: 80%; padding-left: <span style="color: red">4em</span>; }<br>
h6 .editsection { font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal; }<br>
