== About ==

Semantic Forms is an extension to MediaWiki that allows for the
creation and usage of forms to add and edit semantic data. It can
work in conjuction with two other extensions that both handle the
storage of data: Semantic MediaWiki and Cargo.

For much more information on Semantic Forms, see the extension
homepage at
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Semantic_Forms

Notes on installing Semantic Forms can be found in the file INSTALL.
