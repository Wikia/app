The Semantic Page Series extension enables the generation of a series of pages
from one Semantic Form.

For details see https://www.mediawiki.org/Extension:Semantic_Page_Series

The development of this extension was sponsored by Prescient Software
(www.prescientsoftware.co.uk).

== Dependencies ==

This extension was developed for MediaWiki 1.17 with at least Semantic
MediaWiki 1.5.3 and Semantic Forms 2.4 installed. Other version might work, but
are not tested.


== Installation ==

1. Download the package. Unpack the folder inside /extensions (so that the files
   are in /extensions/SemanticPageSeries, rename the folder if necessary).

2. In your LocalSettings.php, add the following line to the end of the file:

   require_once("$IP/extensions/SemanticPageSeries/SemanticPageSeries.php");


=== Configuration parameters ===

The following settings may be used:

* $spsgPageGenerationLimits to specify the maximum number of pages that may be
  generated per request by a member of a user group. If a user is in more than
  one group, the highest number is used.

  Default setting:

    $spsgPageGenerationLimits = array(
      '*' => 0,
      'user' => 10,
      'sysop' => SPS_NOLIMIT
    );

If you want to use these settings, just include them in LocalSettings.php AFTER
the require_once("$IP/extensions/SemanticPageSeries/SemanticPageSeries.php");
