The Back-And-Forth extension adds "previous" and "next" links at the top
of the page when viewing articles, which point to the pages which
alphabetically precede and follow the current one.

== Requirements ==

The Back-And-Forth extension requires MediaWiki 1.10.0 or above.

== Installation ==

1. Place extension files into a "BackAndForth" directory in your
   MediaWiki "extensions/" directory
   
2. Add the line
   `require_once( "{$IP}/extensions/BackAndForth/BackAndForth.php" );`
   to LocalSettings.php.

Installation can be verified through the Special:Version page on the wiki.

Links may not show up immediately due to client-side or other caches.
