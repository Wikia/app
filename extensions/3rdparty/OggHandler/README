This extension provides a media handler for the Ogg container format. When
enabled, a player will be automatically embedded in the image description page, 
or any wiki page using the same syntax as for images. 

To install this extension, add the following to the end of your LocalSettings.php:

    require( "$IP/extensions/OggHandler/OggHandler.php" );

FFmpeg
------

We use FFmpeg for creating still images of videos, you will need a copy on your 
server. 

Some old versions of FFmpeg had a bug which made it extremely slow to seek in 
large theora videos in order to generate a thumbnail. This is fixed in the
current version. If you are using an old version of FFmpeg and find that
performance is extremely poor (tens of seconds) to generate thumbnails of 
theora videos that are several minutes or more in length, try applying our
ffmpeg-bugfix.diff.

Suggested configure line for minimal functionality:

./configure --disable-demuxers --disable-muxers --disable-decoders --disable-encoders \
  --disable-ffserver --disable-ffplay --enable-encoder=mjpeg --enable-muxer=mjpeg \
  --enable-decoder=theora --enable-demuxer=ogg --disable-network \
  --build-suffix=-still

Set the FFmpeg binary location with:

    $wgFFmpegLocation = '/path/to/ffmpeg';

after the require line in LocalSettings.php. 

Cortado
-------

Wikimedia maintains a fork of the Cortado Java applet by Fluendo. SVN access to
the source code is at:

    http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/mediawiki/trunk/cortado/

A .jar file compiled from this tree is provided in the OggHandler directory for
your convenience.

For information about the original project see:

    http://www.flumotion.net/cortado/

See LICENSE.cortado, LICENSE.jheora and LICENSE.smoke for license information. 

Our fork contains several bug fixes and feature additions. Fluendo appears to 
have stopped maintaining Cortado. We recommend you file bug reports in
Wikimedia's bug tracker.

PEAR File_Ogg
-------------

I forked the PEAR File_Ogg package and improved it significantly in order to 
support this extension. I have now taken over maintainership of File_Ogg and 
merged my changes into the latest release. This extension will now work with 
either the bundled File_Ogg class, or a File_Ogg package from PEAR with 
version 0.3.0 or greater. It is licensed under the LGPL.
