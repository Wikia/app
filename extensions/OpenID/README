MediaWiki OpenID extension

version 0.9.0
20 June 2009

This is the README file for the OpenID extension for MediaWiki software. The
extension is only useful if you've got a MediaWiki installation; it can only be
installed by the administrator of the site.

The extension lets users log in with an OpenID (http://www.openid.net/) instead
of a username and password. An OpenID is a special URL that people can use to
log in to a Web site. The extension also lets users who have an account on the
wiki log in to other OpenID-aware Web sites with their wiki user page as their
OpenID.

Typical uses:

* Single-signon between multiple affiliated wikis and other sites. We have
  almost 20 wikis that work together for Wikitravel, and users can login to
  different Wikitravel wikis with their home wiki account.
* Single-signon across the Internet. Many, many sites now support OpenID,
  including "big names" like Yahoo!, Google, and AOL. Allowing users to login
  with OpenID means one less step for them to contribute to your wiki.
* Distributed reputation. Logging into a new wiki with the same username as you
  have on another wiki doesn't prove that they're the same person. Logging in
  with your OpenID from the old wiki does. Using OpenID can help build a
  distributed reputation across the wiki world.

The software supports OpenID 2.0 and '''requires''' the openidenabled.com 2.x
libraries. Users of previous versions should see [[#Upgrade]] for more
information.

This extension has been in use for years on several large wikis without known
security problems. However, no software is completely bug-free or secure, and
there's no guarantee that this software will work as advertised. See [[#Bugs]]
section below for info on how to report problems.

Patches for YADIS support and FileStore storage by Jonathan Daugherty
<cygnus@janrain.com>.

== Pre-requisites ==

This software has been tested in production with MediaWiki 1.11.x. It may or
may not work with earlier or later versions, but I'm interested in making later
versions work, and I'd be happy to make minor changes to make older, unsupported
versions work too.

The software depends on the OpenIDEnabled.com PHP library for OpenID, which in
turn depends on the OpenIDEnabled.com PHP library for YADIS. At the time of this
writing, info on installing these libraries was available here:

	  http://www.openidenabled.com/php-openid/

The last version tested with is 2.0.1; '''versions below 2.0 will not work'''.
If you must use version 1.x of the openidenabled.com library, you can use the
unsupported version 0.7.0 or below of this extension.

There are also some required PHP extensions; see the OpenIDEnabled documentation
for details. This software has been tested with the gmp and curl PHP extensions
installed, and it's recommended that you install them, too.

Note that some versions of MediaWiki overwrite the PHP library path in
LocalSettings.php. You may need to add the path to your PHP library directory
to the $path variable, like "/usr/share/php" or "/usr/local/share/php".

== Installation ==

To install, copy all the files in the archive you downloaded to the OpenID
subdirectory of the extensions subdirectory of your MediaWiki installation. Note
that the software depends on having its code all in the "OpenID" sub-directory;
naming it "OpenID-Test" or "newextension1" or whatever won't work.

Run update.php script in in your MediaWiki maintenance folder to create
necessary tables in MediaWiki database.

Version 0.3 and below of this extension used a different database structure
that was pretty inefficient. If you installed this extension before, you should
copy the optionToTable.php script to your MediaWiki "maintenance" directory and
run it from the command line. This will copy the OpenID mappings from the user
table to the new table (but it doesn't erase the old data... just in case).

In your MediaWiki LocalSettings.php, add the following line some place towards
the bottom of the file:

	require_once( "$IP/extensions/OpenID/OpenID.setup.php" );

Theoretically it should work out of the box, but you'll almost definitely want
to set the trust root and access controls (see Configuration below).

== Upgrade ==

'''This is an incompatible upgrade to the previous version of the MediaWiki
OpenID library.''' In particular, the interfaces of the openidenabled.com
libraries have changed from 1.x to 2.x, and no effort has been made to retain
backwards compatibility with the 1.x versions of the library.

To upgrade, you'll need to do at least the following:

* Install the 2.x version of the openidenabled.com PHP OpenID library.
* Check that your consumer and server stores are correct. I got tired of
  maintaining the MemcStore that nobody seemed to want, so if you used that, you
  need to use the filestore now. See below for how to configure it.
* Change your require_once line in LocalSettings.php to use the .setup.php file.
* 'openidlogininstructions' is now wikitext, not HTML. If you've customized it,
  you may need to re-customize it. Also, it's now shown '''below''' the login
  box, so if you say ''the box below'', you may want to change that to ''the box
  above''.
* The extension has been converted to use a clumsy and perverse OOP-like
  structure, with one class per special page. Most function names have been
  changed to methods of these classes. If you used them, look around for their
  replacements.
* The extension has been converted to use the autoloading features of MediaWiki,
  which means that you need to require() the files directly if you really want
  to use their code. Or you might get lucky and have autoloading work for you.

If you find other incompatibilities that I haven't mentioned here, please let
me know.

== Logging in using OpenID ==

To log in to the wiki using an OpenID, go to the Special:OpenIDLogin
page on the wiki. Add the OpenID identity URL to the login box, and
click "Verify".

This ''should'' take you to the OpenID server for your identity, where
you can either log in (if you're not already) or approve allowing the
wiki to use your OpenID for logging in. If the OpenID server supports
the Simple Registration Extension ('sreg'), it may also ask you
whether to share personal information like your preferred nickname,
real name, email address, etc. Choose as you wish.

Once you're logged in to your OpenID server, and you've finished
approving the login, you should return to the wiki from whence you
came automatically.

Every user who logs in with an OpenID identity for the first time will
be assigned a "fake" username in the local wiki. (This just makes
things work better.)

If you've allowed your nickname to be passed to the wiki, and it's not
already taken, and it's a legal MediaWiki user name, then it should
use that for your login automatically.

If not, the extension will try to make up some good candidate
usernames for you and present you with a choice. If you don't like any
of them, you can make up your own.

After you're logged in, you can edit, read, write, and do all the
other things that MediaWiki users do. Since you've got a "real"
account, you'll also have a home page and a message page and such. It
should also be possible to assign extra permissions ('sysop',
'bureaucrat') to the account. You can log out as normal.

To log back in, use the OpenIDLogin page again. Don't try to login
using the regular login page, since it won't work.

You can log in with an Interwiki abbreviation of an URL right now, but
that's experimental and may disappear in later versions. Don't fall in
love with this convenient, useful feature. You may get hurt.

== Using a MediaWiki account as an OpenID ==

To log in to other sites with your MediaWiki account, your OpenID
identity URL is the full URL of your MediaWiki user page. So, for
example, the author's identity URL is:

	 http://wikitravel.org/en/User:Evan

When you use this OpenID with another site, logging in should take you
to the wiki site. You may need to enter your password if you're not
already logged in.

You'll then be asked if you want to let the other site log you in, and
if you want the MediaWiki wiki to share your personal information
(nickname, email, full name, language) with the other site. Choose
what feels comfortable to you. For some sites, you may not be asked;
see Configuration below.

Once you've finished deciding, the other site will finish the login.

You can't log in through OpenID on the same server. You can't use the
user page for a fake account created for an OpenID login as an OpenID
itself.

== Configuration ==

The administrator can configure these variables in the
LocalSettings.php file. Please read carefully.

* $wgTrustRoot -- This is an URL that identifies your site to OpenID
  servers. Typically, it's the "root" url of the site, like
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/" or "http://wikitravel.org/it/". If this is
  not set, the software will make a half-hearted guess, but it's not
  very good and you should probably just set it.

* $wgOpenIDConsumerDenyByDefault -- The administrator can decide which
  OpenIDs are allowed to login to their server. If this flag is
  true, only those OpenIDs that match one of the $wgOpenIDConsumerAllow
  and not one of the $wgOpenIDConsumerDeny patterns will be allowed to
  log in. If it is false, all OpenIDs are allowed to log in, unless
  they are matched by an $wgOpenIDConsumerDeny pattern and not an
  $wgOpenIDConsumerAllow. Typically you'll set this to true for
  testing and then false for general use.

* $wgOpenIDConsumerAllow -- an array of regular expressions that match
  OpenIDs you want to allow to log in. For example,
  "@^(http://)?wikitravel.org/@" will allow OpenIDs from the Wikitravel
  domain.

* $wgOpenIDConsumerDeny -- an array of regular expressions that match
  OpenIDs you want to deny access to. This is mostly useful for
  servers that are known to be bad. Example: "#^(http://)?example.com/#".

* $wgOpenIDConsumerForce -- a single provider which will always be used,
  bypassing the selection dialog and manual entry.  Useful for team wikis
  using a provider such as Google Apps for Your Domain.
  
* $wgOpenIDUseEmailAsNickname -- designed for use with the above, parse 
  the e-mail address provided by your provider and use the user component
  as the MediaWiki username.

* $wgOpenIDTrustEmailAddress -- trust the e-mail address sent by the 
  provider and don't require it to be verified.  If false (the default), 
  all new users will be required to validate their e-mail address.

* $wgOpenIDServerForceAllowTrust -- an array of regular expressions
  that match trust roots that you want to skip trust checks for when
  the user logs in from those sites. A typical example would be a
  closely federated cluster of sites (like Wikimedia, Wikia, or
  Wikitravel) where the personal data is available to the trusting
  server ''anyways''. Be very careful using this across organizational
  boundaries.

* $wgOpenIDConsumerStoreType and $wgOpenIDServerStoreType -- strings
  denoting the type of storage to be used to store OpenID assocation
  data when acting as an OpenID relying party (consumer) and server,
  respectively. Valid values are "file", "memcached" and "db".

* $wgOpenIDConsumerStorePath and $wgOpenIDServerStorePath -- strings
  specifying the paths where OpenID assocation data should be stored
  when acting as a relying party (consumer) or server, respectively.
  Each of these need only be set if the store type settings (above)
  are set to "file", respectively.  These strings, if both are set,
  MUST NOT be equal. If the store type is "file", the default here is
  "/tmp/$wgDBname/openidconsumer/" and "/tmp/$wgDBname/openidserver/"
  respectively. The path will be automatically created if it doesn't
  exist at runtime.

* $wgHideOpenIDLoginLink -- boolean that says whether or not to hide
  the OpenID login link in the personal URLs. Typically you'd use this
  if you've already got some other method for showing the OpenID login
  link, like in your skin. Note that it will *not* prevent login if
  the user navigates to Special:OpenIDLogin directly; it's simply
  cosmetic. This is mostly a backwards-compatibility option.

* $wgOpenIDLoginLogoUrl -- Url of the OpenID login logo. Defaults to
  'http://www.openid.net/login-bg.gif', but you may want to move it to
  a local URL, or an URL on a CDN, if that kind of thing floats your
  boat.

* $wgOpenIDShowUrlOnUserPage -- whether to show the OpenID identity URL
  on a user's home page. Possible values are 'always', 'never', or 'user'
  (lets the user decide). Default is 'user'.

* $wgOpenIDOnly -- defaults to false. With this enabled, users can
  ''only'' log in with OpenID. This is principally of interest to
  OpenID advocacy sites like openid.net, but you may want it, too.

* $wgOpenIDClientOnly -- defaults to false. With this enabled, users
  cannot use their accounts on the local wiki as OpenIDs on another
  site. Sucks for users, but some admins have emailed me about not
  wanting the responsibility of being an OpenID server, so this flag
  is for them.

* $wgOpenIDShowProviderIcons -- defaults to false due to potential
  brand issues. With this enabled, users will see button graphics
  instead of just links in OpenID provider UI.

== Skins ==

If you are customizing a skin, and you want to show the OpenID
identity for a user (say, on their user page), use the function
OpenIDGetUserUrl($user). It takes a User object (not a name or an id!)
and returns the user's OpenID identity if it exists, or null if it
doesn't.

== Translation ==

The user interface strings for this extension are configurable through
the same Special:Allmessages page as MediaWiki itself. They all start
with "openid", and they're no more or less cryptic than MediaWiki's.
You can look at OpenID.i18n.php for some details.

== OpenID services ==

These are some of the OpenID services I tested this extension with;
all have free signup for identities if you want to test, too.

* http://www.myopenid.com/ -- uses Simple Registration Extension
* http://getopenid.com/
* http://www.typekey.com/
* http://www.claimid.com/
* http://pip.verisignlabs.com/
* http://certifi.ca/

== Bugs ==

Please submit bugs into [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=MediaWiki%20extensions&component=OpenID Bugzilla under OpenID extenson component].

== TODO ==
* Move TODO file and things below into Bugzilla

The TODO file in this distribution has stuff I think needs to be
todone; + marks show things I've already done, and - shows things
that are yet to be done.

The big changes for the future:

* Configure some stuff through Special:Preferences or a dedicated
  control panel
* Auto-login if you've logged in before with an OpenID, and are logged
  into that account now
