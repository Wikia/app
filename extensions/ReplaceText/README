== Overview ==

Replace Text is an extension to MediaWiki that creates a new special page,
Special:ReplaceText, available to administrators only (defined as anyone
who has 'delete' privileges on pages), that does a text find-and-replace
on all pages in the wiki, except the Talk pages and the ones in the wiki's
own project namespace. Only the contents of pages are affected, not their
titles. The search is case-sensitive.

Since the replacement is not undoable, if the replacement string is
blank or a string that is already contained in the wiki, the 'ReplaceText'
page prompts the user to confirm the replacement before it is performed.

Each replacement shows up as a wiki edit, with the administrator who
performed the replacement appearing as the user and an edit summary
that looks like "Text replace: 'search string' to 'replacement string'".

== Requirements ==

This version of the Replace Text extension requires MediaWiki 1.8 or higher.

== Installation ==

== Contact ==
