# WikiEditor provides enhancements to the MediaWiki edit page

# This extension requires MediaWiki 1.17+ because it makes use of ResourceLoader.

# Example LocalSettings.php additions

require_once( "$IP/extensions/WikiEditor/WikiEditor.php" );

# Before configuring this extension, see WikiEditor.php and become familiar with the initial state and structure of the
# $wgWikiEditorFeatures configuration variable. Essentially it's an array of arrays, keyed by feature name, each
# containing global and user keys with boolean values. "global" indicates that it should be turned on for everyone
# always, while user indicates that users should be allowed to turn it on or off in their user preferences.

# To enable a preference by default but still allow users to disable it in preferences, use something like...

$wgDefaultUserOptions['usebetatoolbar'] = 1;
$wgDefaultUserOptions['usebetatoolbar-cgd'] = 1;
$wgDefaultUserOptions['wikieditor-preview'] = 1;
