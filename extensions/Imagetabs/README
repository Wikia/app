1. INTRODUCTION
When you use one wiki as an image repository for multiple wikis (through shared uploads), it's hard to find out where a specific image is used, as you have to check it at all wikis. This extension makes this easier by adding interwiki tabs above Image: pages.

2. WHERE TO GET IMAGETABS
You can download a tarball at http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:ExtensionDistributor/Imagetabs .

3. INSTALLATION
Download the tarball (see section 2) and extract it in /path/to/your/wiki/extensions .

Open LocalSettings.php and add the following three lines just before the end:

require_once("$IP/extensions/Imagetabs/imagetabs.php");
$wgEnableInterwikiImageTabs = true;
$wgInterwikiImageTabs = array();

For information on how to configure Imagetabs, see section 4.

4. CONFIGURATION
Imagetabs is configured by modifying the $wgEnableInterwikiImageTabs and $wgInterwikiImageTabs variables that you added to LocalSettings.php in section 3.

4A. TURNING IMAGETABS ON AND OFF
To enable Imagetabs, set $wgEnableInterwikiImageTabs to true in LocalSettings.php. To turn it off, set it to false. In the latter case, the tabs won't be shown.

4B. SPECIFYING TAB CAPTIONS AND TARGETS
The $wgInterwikiImageTabs array in LocalSettings.php (see also section 3) lists which tabs you want to appear, and where they should link to. The format is:

$wgInterwikiImageTabs = array(
	'prefix1' => 'caption1',
	'prefix2' => 'caption2',
	'prefix3' => 'caption3'
);

With this sample configuration, three extra tabs will appear above each image page. The first will link to [[prefix1:Image:Imagename]] and has the caption "caption1", etc. The prefixes refer to the interwiki prefixes in the interwiki table. An extension that makes managing the interwiki table easy may be found at http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Special_page_to_work_with_the_interwiki_table

NOTE: Imagetabs will silently refuse to create a tab that links to the same wiki you're currently viewing. This means that you can use the same array for all of your wikis, and Imagetabs will automatically figure out which tab to hide. If you rely on this feature, do make sure that you've set $wgLocalInterwiki (also in LocalSettings.php) correctly.
