== Disclaimer ==

For a proper legal disclaimer, see the file "COPYING".

== Requirements ==

The extension requires an install of Semantic MediaWiki 1.5 or
greater. For more details, see Semantic MediaWiki's own
installation requirements.

== Installation ==

(1) Extract the archive to obtain the directory "SemanticDrilldown"
    that contains all relevant files. Copy this directory (or
    extract/download it) to "[wikipath]/extensions/".
(2) Insert the following line into the file "[wikipath]/LocalSettings.php":
      include_once('extensions/SemanticDrilldown/includes/SD_Settings.php');

'''Remark:'''  Semantic Drilldown creates an additional custom namespace,
"Filter" (see http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Using_custom_namespaces). If
you have your own custom namespaces, you have to set the parameter
$sdgNamespaceIndex before including SD_Settings.php. See SD_Settings.php
for more details.
