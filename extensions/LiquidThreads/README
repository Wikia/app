STATUS:
======

This software is beta. There are bugs and missing features. But it is
basically usable, and you are encouraged to try it (with caution). Also, please
hack Liquid Threads and make it more awesome.

INSTALLATION:
============

1. Rename this directory to extensions/LiquidThreads inside your
   MediaWiki directory.
2. Cause your MySQL server to execute the statements in lqt.sql.
   (On Unix, you can say, "mysql -u $USER -p -e 'source lqt.sql'".)
3. Add this line to the end of your LocalSettings.php:
   require_once('extensions/LiquidThreads/LqtPages.php');

Liquid Threads uses namespace numbers 90, 91, 92, and 93. If you are using
another extension which uses any of these numbers, you should have Liquid
Threads use different numbers by adding something like the following to your
LocalSettings.php, *before* including LqtPages.php:

$egLqtNamespaceNumbers = array(
    'Thread' => 100,
    'Thread_talk' => 101,
    'Summary' => 102,
    'Summary_talk' => 103
);

UPGRADES:
========

If you are upgrading from an earlier version of Liquid Threads, instead of
sourcing lqt.sql, you should source the appropriate schema change files, in
order:

lqt-schema-change-1.sql for before r25931
lqt-schema-change-2.sql for before r26550
lqt-schema-change-3.sql for before r26563
lqt-schema-change-4.sql for before r26575
lqt-schema-change-5.sql for before r28178
lqt-schema-change-6.sql for before r28693
