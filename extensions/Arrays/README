== Installation ==

Once you have downloaded the code, place the 'Array' directory within your
MediaWiki 'extensions' directory. Then add the following code to your
[[Manual:LocalSettings.php|LocalSettings.php]] file:

 # Arrays
 require_once( "$IP/extensions/Arrays/Arrays.php" );
 
Be aware of breaking behavioral changes introduced after version 1.3.2. There is a
new configuration variable '$egArraysCompatibilityMode' for switching back to old
behavior though. For further information see the 'RELEASE-NOTES' file.
