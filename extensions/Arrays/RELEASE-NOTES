 ==========

 * December 5, 2011 -- Version 2.0rc2
    - Bug introduced in r105069 fixed where '#arrayprint' was broken in compatibility mode in some cases.
    - '#arraysearcharray' with 'e' using 'Regex Fun' no longer requires an escaped transform (parameter 6)
      input. It works just like the '#regex' parser functions replacement parameter.

 * December 4, 2011 -- Version 2.0rc1
    This release is built upon 1.4 alpha. See changes of 1.4 alpha as well.
    'ArrayExtension' is now simply called 'Arrays'. Therefore you have to adjust your LocalSettings.php.
    - Compatibility mode variable '$egArraysCompatibilityMode' ('$egArrayExtensionCompatbilityMode' in
      Version 1.4 alpha) is set to false by default. See Version 1.4 alpha for further information.
    - Additional changes to the compatibility mode behavior in version 2.0 include:
      + '#arrayindex' will return its default also in case of existing index but empty value. This
        makes the function consistent with Variables '#var' and HashTables '#hashvalue'.
      + '#arrayunion', '#arraydiff' and '#arrayintersect' with only one array for the operation will make
        a copy of that array instead of creating no array at all (just like '#arraymerge' behaved already).
      + Default separator for '#arrayprint' now is the languages default separator instead of ', '.
	  + '#arrayprint' will no longer expand the given wiki markup twice. Instead, it will escape special
	    characters of array values before they will be inserted into the markup. This way it won't be
		possible anymore that array values can break the functions output. '$egArraysExpansionEscapeTemplates'
		defines which special characters should be escaped by which template/parser function.
      + *** See 1.4 alpha for previous changes ***
    - '#arrayindex' will only expand options/default when required.
    - '#arraymerge', '#arrayunion', '#arraydiff' and '#arrayintersect' can handle multiple arrays now.
    - '#arraydefine' option 'print' no longer supports 'print=print' and parameters beyond options.
      This functionality never worked reliably anyways. 'print=list' still works.
    - '#arrayprint' now has a new parameter for options. Option 'print=pretty' will print a list where
      the last two strings are chained with an ' and ' or the local languages equivalent. 'print=pretty'
      also can be used as option within '#arraydefine'.
    - If 'Regex Fun' extension is installed, '#arraysearcharray' can use Regex Funs 'e' flag feature
      for transforming the result and at the same time parsing them after each back-reference inclusion.
    - 1.4 alpha bug solved, '#arraysearcharray' with empty string as start index was interpreted as 0.
    - class 'ArrayExtension' renamed to 'ExtArrays'.


 * November 20, 2001 -- Version 1.4 alpha (r103716)
    This release introduces some useful bugfixes and optional new behavior for various functionality.
    This version never made it into a final stage because version 2.0 will introduce some rather
    radical changes, so this alpha release allows to profit from bugfixes that might be quite useful
    if you don't want to use Version 2.0 for some reason.
    - Configuration variable '$egArrayExtensionCompatbilityMode' for deactivating the following newly
      introduced breaking changes:
      + '#arrayprint' no longer returns an error text in case the array doesn't exist.
      + '#arrayreset' now uses n parameters instead of ',' as separator for n arrays to reset
      + '#arrayindex' options removed, instead third parameter simply is the default value (without
        any 'default=' in front).
      + '#arraysearch' returns an empty string '' instead of '-1' in case nothing was found.
      + '#arraysearcharray' and '#arrayslice' without all necessary parameters set will always create
        a new empty array.
      Compatibility mode is active by default. In Version 2.0 it will be set to inactive by default.
    - '#arraysearch' will only expand 'yes' or 'no' if given, but never both.
    - negative indexes for '#arrayindex', '#arraysearch' and '#arraysearcharray' are possible now.
    - bugfix in '#arraysearcharray', index and limit working fine now.
    - arrayprint will handle <includeonly>/<noinclude> correct in case it's used in a template.
    - Internationalization for several languages added.	
    - moved into mediawiki.org svn repository.

      trouble in other arrayfunctions like arraysearch)

      Pivate function isValidRegEx() added
    - '#arraymerge' bug fixed: Php message in case of non existant seccond array

   - fixed bug in arrayslice (offset can be greater than array size): if offset is no less than array
     size, empty array will be returned, if offset if no greater than negative array size, a new array
     with all elements will be returned
   - update arrayindex by adding print option when (i) the array is not defined; (ii) the index is not
     valid in the specified array: e.g. "default=bad array"
