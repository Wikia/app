As of MediaWiki 1.16.0 this extension is obsolete due to core functionality for
revision deletion (oversight) [1]. As such, new installations of this extension are
redundant. This extension is not actively maintained, and as of September 2015 is
not is not even used on Wikimedia Wikis anymore.

Migration of any revisions hidden by the Oversight extension can be migrated to using
revision delete by using the migrateToRevDel.php maintenance script that exists in the
extension directory. You'll also want fixMigratedLogSearch.php.
