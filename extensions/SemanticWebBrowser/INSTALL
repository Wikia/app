Semantic Web Browser, Version 0.2

Copy all files into MediaWiki's extensions folder, either by using SVN or by
extracting an installation package. You need to enter one line to your local
settings (somewhere after the inclusion of Semantic MediaWiki):

For installation, add 

#Semantic WebBrowser
include_once("$IP/extensions/SemanticWebBrowser/SemanticWebBrowser.php");

to LocalSettings.php
