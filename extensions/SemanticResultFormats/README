= Semantic Result Formats =

Semantic Result Formats is an extension to MediaWiki that bundles a number of
result formats for Semantic MediaWiki's inline queries. The individual formats
can be added to the installation independently. This file contains an
overview on how to install and configure the formats, as well as an overview
of all included formats.

Semantic Result Formats requires Semantic MediaWiki to run, at least at the
same second-level version number as Semantic Result Formats, i.e. SRF 1.5.0
requires SMW 1.5.0.

For more information, see the SRF homepage at:

properties as the headers.

=== sum ===

Displays the sum of the numeric values of the queried property.

=== average ===

Displays the average of the numeric values of the queried property.

=== min ===

Displays the smallest of the numeric values of the queried property.

=== max ===

Displays the largest of the numeric values of the queried property.

=== googlepie ===

Creates a pie chart out of the numeric values of a specific property using
the Google Charts API. This format sends data to Google for formatting.

=== googlebar ===

Creates a bar chart out of the numeric values of a specific property using
the Google Charts API. This format sends data to Google for formatting.

Creates an interactive browsing/filtering interface for displaying query
results. Various display modes are supported. One is Google Maps, which
requires data to be transmitted to Google.

=== ploticus ===

Creates a variety of graph types using the Ploticus application, which must be
