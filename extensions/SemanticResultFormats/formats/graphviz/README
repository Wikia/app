Graph is a query printer for Semantic MediaWiki applying the
GraphViz extension in order to create graphs out of query results.

== Installation ==
The following two MediaWiki installations should be installed and running.
Please test them separately from this extension -- especially the GraphViz
extension is a bit hard to install.
1) Semantic MediaWiki
2) GraphViz
When both of them are up and running, you can install this extension like
any other semantic result printer (refer to the separate README for that).

== Configuration and Usage ==
For an up to date documentation please refer to
