prefabs directory
=================
- additional SMW prefabs.  To use, copy the files in this directory into the PLOTICUS prefabs directory. 

* pietopn.pl (In Development)
- similar to pie but with an additional parameter
  topn (specifies the number of top pie slices after which, remaining slices are aggregated into one slice)

* scats.pl
- modified version of scats.pl.  To install, just replace the existing scats.pl.  
For scatter plots, when corr=yes, the Pearson coefficient is displayed.
In the stock version, the variables are displayed right-justified which works without problems using
raster formats (png, gif, jpeg).  However, vector formats (eps,ps,swf,svg) often crop the variables out unless -pagesize is explicitly specified.  In this version, the variables are always displayed left-justified so they will never be cropped out.
