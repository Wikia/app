== Installation ==

Installation instructions are available online in a more convenient form for
reading at https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Semantic_Result_Formats

Copy all files into MediaWiki's extensions folder, either by using SVN or by
extracting an installation package. You need to enter one line to your local
settings (somewhere after the inclusion of Semantic MediaWiki):

// Semantic Result Formats
require_once( "$IP/extensions/SemanticResultFormats/SemanticResultFormats.php" );

If nothing else is added, a default set of formats is enabled. These are the
the formats that satisfy the following criteria:

* they do not require further software to be installed (besides SMW),
* they do not transmit any data to external websites, not even by making client
  browsers request any static external resources (such as an externally hosted
  image file),
* they are considered reasonably stable and secure.

Currently, these default formats thus are:
'vcard', 'icalendar', 'calendar', 'timeline', 'eventline', 'bibtex', 'outline',
'gallery', 'jqplotbar', 'jqplotpie', 'sum', 'average', 'min', 'max', 'tagcloud',
'median', 'product', 'valuerank', 'array', 'tree', 'ultree', 'oltree',
'D3Line'¹, 'D3Bar'¹, 'D3Treemap'¹, 'hash'².

¹ from MediaWiki 1.17 onwards
² with HashTables extension installed

To add more formats to this list, you can add lines like:

 $srfgFormats[] = 'googlebar';

... or you can override the set of formats entirely, with a call like:

 $srfgFormats = array( 'calendar', 'timeline' );

There are some formats that you may not want to include because they may
not follow certain policies within your wiki; the formats 'googlebar' and
'googlepie', for instance, send data to external web services for rendering,
which may be considered a data leak.

Notes on specific formats:
* eventline: requires Javascript to render.
* exhibit: requires Javascript to render; requires access to Javascript files
  hosted by MIT (not locally included), but does not send any data to MIT
  (besides the requester's IP and the URL of the site with the query). Some
  subformats of Exhibit, like the Google Maps view, send data to Google for
  rendering.
* googlebar: sends data to Google for rendering.  Googlebar requires
  access to the Google servers in order to render.
* googlepie: sends data to Google for rendering.  Googlepie requires
  access to the Google servers in order to render.
* graph: in order to get the graph format to run, you first must have
  the MediaWiki Graph extension running.
* jqplotbar: requires Javascript to render.
* jqplotpie: requires Javascript to render.
* process: in order to get the process format to run, you first must
  have the MediaWiki Graph extension running
* ploticus: requires that the Ploticus application be installed on the
  server.
* timeline: requires Javascript to render.
