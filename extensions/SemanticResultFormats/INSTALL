== Installation ==

Installation instructions are available online in a more convenient form for
reading at:

 http://semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Semantic_Result_Formats

Copy all files into MediaWiki's extensions folder, either by using SVN or by
extracting an installation package. You need to enter two lines to your local
settings (after the inclusion of Semantic MediaWiki). The first one is to
include the code:

 require_once("$IP/extensions/SemanticResultFormats/SRF_Settings.php");

If nothing else is added, the following formats will be enabled: 'calendar',
'timeline', 'eventline', 'sum', 'average', 'min' and 'max'. To add more
formats to this list, you can add lines like:

 $srfgFormats[] = 'googlebar';

...or you can override the set of formats entirely, with a call like:

 $srfgFormats = array('calendar', 'timeline');

...using one or more of the following values:

  average, calendar, eventline, googlebar, googlepie, graph, max, min,
  sum, timeline

There are some formats that you may not want to include because they may
not follow certain policies within your wiki; the formats 'googlebar' and
'googlepie', for instance, send data to external web services for rendering,
which may be considered a data leak.

Notes on specific formats:
* eventline: requires Javascript to render.
* googlebar: note that Googlebar sends data to Google for rendering.
  Googlebar requires access to the Google servers in order to render.
* googlepie: note that Googlepie is sends data to Google for rendering.
  Googlepie requires access to the Google servers in order to render.
* graph: in order to get the graph format to run, you first must have
  the MediaWiki Graph extension running.
* timeline: requires Javascript to render.
