<h4 class="section-header">Welcome</h4>
<p>This is Wikia's first draft of a style guide and represents a work-in-progress, with the goal of changing in smaller increments over time, as styles are tested with real world use cases.</p>
<p>The document is primarily aimed at international designers and developers at this time in order to drive greater consistency across design and front-end development, but it is available to anyone interested.</p>

<h4 class="section-header">Upcoming Style Guide Projects</h4>
<p>The style guide will be evolved in the context of larger projects, in order to test use cases in a live environment with the broader Wikia community.</p>
<p>Known upcoming projects include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Abstraction of an initial user eperience pattern library</li>
    <li>Adjustments for mobile and tablet web</li>
    <li>Inclusion of style guide for Wikia native apps across iOS and Android</li>
</ul>
