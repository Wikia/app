<h1>Typography</h1>
<p><strong>Helvetica Neue</strong> &mdash; This typeface, designed by Max Miedinger and other project members at the Haas'sche Schriftgiesserei, has become one of the most famous and popular typefaces in the world, thanks to the marketing strategy of Stempel and Linotype. It forms an integral part of many printers and operating systems. The original letterforms of Helvetica had to be modified for the Linotype system. Over the years, Helvetica was expanded to include many different weights, but these were not coordinated with each other.</p>
<p><strong>Font Family:</strong> "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif;</p>

        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>As Dog lay unconscious, Logan unsheathed his claws, for the first time in public (to the shock of everyone watching), and was about to deal the deathblow, when Rose leaped in to stop him, but was accidentally impaled by his claws. Horrified, Logan held her in his arms as she died. Stricken with grief and guilt for the death of his first love, Logan fled into the nearby woods, where he lived in self-imposed exile in a feral state with a pack of wolves for months, if not years.</p>
