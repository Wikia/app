## Issues: Bugs, Feature Requests, etc..,
If you find a bug in the style guide, have a feature request or have any other type of issue, please use the [new issue form](https://github.com/Wikia/style-guide/issues/new) to let us know. Make sure to apply the most appropriate label to your issue as well.

## Submitting a Pull Request
If your pull request fixes an existing issue, please reference that issue from within your pull request.

As the coverage of our style guide grows, developers from all teams are encouraged to helm the responsibility of building new components for the style guide. Before submitting a pull request, [open an issue](https://github.com/Wikia/style-guide/issues/new) for the new component. This allows other developers to engage in a discussion that may be useful to your development.
Before submitting your pull request, please make sure that all of the following are true:
* Your pull request has a comprehensive description of the new component/feature being added
* You have linked to the [original issue](https://github.com/Wikia/style-guide/issues) from within your PR description
* For new components, make sure your source lives [here](https://github.com/Wikia/style-guide/tree/master/src/scss/lib/components)
* Make sure your code is linted and follows the [Wikia SCSS guidelines](https://github.com/Wikia/guidelines/tree/master/SCSS)
* As this is a living style guide, make sure you add an entry or section for your component in the [Jekyll GitHub Pages site](https://github.com/Wikia/style-guide/tree/dev/gh-pages) and update the gh-pages branch using: `$ bash update-gh-pages.sh` to see [http://wikia.github.io/style-guide](http://wikia.github.io/style-guide) updated
