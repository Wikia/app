# Pageview time

This small script sets up some DOM events for monitoring how much time user spends on a given site.

## Usage

The script is automatically available on `window` object when loaded on a webpage. In order to perform a setup process the page
needs to invoke `window.pageviewTime()` as soon as possible to correctly measure time the user spends on a give webpage.

The tests performed so far show that the script collects all the data on Chrome webbrowser, however, it has some issues with Firefox.
