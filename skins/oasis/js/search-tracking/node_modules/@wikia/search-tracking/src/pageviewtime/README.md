# Pageview time
This small script sets up some DOM events for monitoring how much time user spends on a given site.

## Usage in non-Single Page Apps
The script is automatically available on `window` object when loaded on a webpage. In order to perform a setup process the page
needs to invoke `window.pageviewTime.setupPageTime(false)` as soon as possible to correctly measure time the user spends on a given webpage.

The tests performed so far show that the script collects all the data on Chrome webbrowser, however, it has some issues with Firefox.

## Usage in Single Page Apps
Since Single Page Apps do not reload the page when transitioning between pages, there is a need to manually 'flush' the events when navigating. To set it up properly
1) Use `window.pageviewTime.setupPageTime()` when your app starts (ASAP)
2) Call `window.pageviewTime.initPageview()` when your app has transitioned to a new page
3) Call `window.pageviewTime.finishPageview()` when your app is going to transition away form a current page

There is no need to perform an on unload / beforeunload event. The script will detect that automatically.
