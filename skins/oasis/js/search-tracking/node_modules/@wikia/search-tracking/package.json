  "readme": "# Search tracking library\n\nThis library allows to build and send data structures that are required to track and analyze\nsearch functionalities on Fandom services.\n\n## Building and running the code\n\nIn order to build, run and have fun with the code you need to have `node` and `npm` installed\nand run `npm install`.\n\nIn order to play with the project run:\n\n```bash\nnpm start\n```\n\nThis command will run a webpack server that will watch for changes in code and hot reload on save.\nMoreover, it will open the window in your system browser and display a blank window. You can run\ndevtools of your browser and try instantiate the classes, build simple pipelines, etc.\n\nIn order to ceate a production version (ES5 minified and uglified) of this script run:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThe new version will be available under `./dist/searchtracking.js`. The users can either directly copy/paste the file or code\nto their codebase or serve it through a CDN.\n\n## Usage on production\n\nThe library exposes only one function on `window` object: `sendEvent`. This function accepts an object with two fields - `type` and `payload`.\nThe type of the event must be on of four options (string):\n\n- \"searchImpression\",\n- \"searchClicked\",\n- \"suggestImpression\",\n- \"suggestClicked\".\n\n`Payload` should contain an object that is build according with the [documentation](https://wikia-inc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DE/pages/474710211/Search+Tracking+Events).\n\nFunction `sendEvent` performs validation of the data structure and sends that data to `beacon.wikia-services.com`. If the value in `payload` is inappropriate it will throw an exception.\n\n## Tests\n\nIn order to run tests run `npm test`. Currently, only limited number of tests is provided. Eventually,\nall fields require in validation process should be tested.\n",
