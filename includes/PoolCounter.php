 *  When you have many workers (threads/servers) giving service, and a

 * doing the job at the same time.
 *
 *  Given enough requests and the item expiring fast (non-cacheable,
 * lots of edits...) that single work can end up unfairly using most (all)
 * of the cpu of the pool. This is also known as 'Michael Jackson effect'
 * since this effect triggered on the english wikipedia on the day Michael
 * Jackson died, the biographical article got hit with several edits per
 * minutes and hundreds of read hits.
 *
 *  The PoolCounter provides semaphore semantics for restricting the number
 * of workers that may be concurrently performing such single task.
 *
 *  By default PoolCounter_Stub is used, which provides no locking. You
 * can get a useful one in the PoolCounter extension.
