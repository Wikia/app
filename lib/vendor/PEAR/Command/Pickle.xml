  <doc>[descfile] [descfile2]
Creates a PECL package from its description file (usually called
package.xml).  If a second packagefile is passed in, then
the packager will check to make sure that one is a package.xml
version 1.0, and the other is a package.xml version 2.0.  The
package.xml version 1.0 will be saved as &quot;package.xml&quot; in the archive,
and the other as &quot;package2.xml&quot; in the archive&quot;

If no second file is passed in, and [descfile] is a package.xml 2.0,
an automatic conversion will be made to a package.xml 1.0.  Note that
only simple package.xml 2.0 will be converted.  package.xml 2.0 with:

 - dependency types other than required/optional PECL package/ext/php/pearinstaller
 - more than one extsrcrelease
 - extbinrelease, phprelease, or bundle release type
 - dependency groups
 - ignore tags in release filelist
 - tasks other than replace
 - custom roles

will cause pickle to fail, and output an error message.  If your package2.xml
uses any of these features, you are best off using PEAR_PackageFileManager to
generate both package.xml.</doc>
