# Changelog

## 0.8.9 (2017-01-18)

*   Feature: Support explicitly choosing TLS version to negotiate with remote side
    by respecting `crypto_method` context parameter for all classes.
    (#149 by @clue)

    By default, all connector and server classes support TLSv1.0+ and exclude
    support for legacy SSLv2/SSLv3. As of PHP 5.6+ you can also explicitly
    choose the TLS version you want to negotiate with the remote side:

    ```php
    // new: now supports 'crypto_method` context parameter for all classes
    $connector = new Connector($loop, array(
        'tls' => array(
            'crypto_method' => STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLSv1_2_CLIENT
        )
    ));
    ```

*   Minor internal clean up to unify class imports
    (#148 by @clue)

## 0.8.8 (2018-01-06)

*   Improve test suite by adding test group to skip integration tests relying on
    internet connection and fix minor documentation typo.
    (#146 by @clue and #145 by @cn007b)

## 0.8.7 (2017-12-24)

*   Fix: Fix closing socket resource before removing from loop
    (#141 by @clue)

    This fixes the root cause of an uncaught `Exception` that only manifested
    itself after the recent Stream v0.7.4 component update and only if you're
    using `ext-event` (`ExtEventLoop`).

*   Improve test suite by testing against PHP 7.2
    (#140 by @carusogabriel)

## 0.8.6 (2017-11-18)

*   Feature: Add Unix domain socket (UDS) support to `Server` with `unix://` URI scheme
    and add advanced `UnixServer` class.
    (#120 by @andig)

    ```php
    // new: Server now supports "unix://" scheme
    $server = new Server('unix:///tmp/server.sock', $loop);

    // new: advanced usage
    $server = new UnixServer('/tmp/server.sock', $loop);
    ```

*   Restructure examples to ease getting started
    (#136 by @clue)

*   Improve test suite by adding forward compatibility with PHPUnit 6 and
    ignore Mac OS X test failures for now until Travis tests work again
    (#133 by @gabriel-caruso and #134 by @clue)

## 0.8.5 (2017-10-23)

*   Fix: Work around PHP bug with Unix domain socket (UDS) paths for Mac OS X
    (#123 by @andig)

*   Fix: Fix `SecureServer` to return `null` URI if server socket is already closed
    (#129 by @clue)

*   Improve test suite by adding forward compatibility with PHPUnit v5 and
    forward compatibility with upcoming EventLoop releases in tests and
    test Mac OS X on Travis
    (#122 by @andig and #125, #127 and #130 by @clue)

*   Readme improvements
    (#118 by @jsor)

## 0.8.4 (2017-09-16)

*   Feature: Add `FixedUriConnector` decorator to use fixed, preconfigured URI instead
    (#117 by @clue)

    This can be useful for consumers that do not support certain URIs, such as
    when you want to explicitly connect to a Unix domain socket (UDS) path
    instead of connecting to a default address assumed by an higher-level API:

    ```php
    $connector = new FixedUriConnector(
        'unix:///var/run/docker.sock',
        new UnixConnector($loop)
    );

    // destination will be ignored, actually connects to Unix domain socket
    $promise = $connector->connect('localhost:80');
    ```

## 0.8.3 (2017-09-08)

*   Feature: Reduce memory consumption for failed connections
    (#113 by @valga)

*   Fix: Work around write chunk size for TLS streams for PHP < 7.1.14
    (#114 by @clue)

## 0.8.2 (2017-08-25)

*   Feature: Update DNS dependency to support hosts file on all platforms
    (#112 by @clue)

    This means that connecting to hosts such as `localhost` will now work as
    expected across all platforms with no changes required:

    ```php
    $connector = new Connector($loop);
    $connector->connect('localhost:8080')->then(function ($connection) {
        // …
    });
    ```

## 0.8.1 (2017-08-15)

* Feature: Forward compatibility with upcoming EventLoop v1.0 and v0.5 and
  target evenement 3.0 a long side 2.0 and 1.0
  (#104 by @clue and #111 by @WyriHaximus)

* Improve test suite by locking Travis distro so new defaults will not break the build and
  fix HHVM build for now again and ignore future HHVM build errors
  (#109 and #110 by @clue)

* Minor documentation fixes
  (#103 by @christiaan and #108 by @hansott)

## 0.8.0 (2017-05-09)

* Feature: New `Server` class now acts as a facade for existing server classes
  and renamed old `Server` to `TcpServer` for advanced usage.
  (#96 and #97 by @clue)

  The `Server` class is now the main class in this package that implements the
  `ServerInterface` and allows you to accept incoming streaming connections,
  such as plaintext TCP/IP or secure TLS connection streams.

  > This is not a BC break and consumer code does not have to be updated.

* Feature / BC break: All addresses are now URIs that include the URI scheme
  (#98 by @clue)

  ```diff
  - $parts = parse_url('tcp://' . $conn->getRemoteAddress());
  + $parts = parse_url($conn->getRemoteAddress());
  ```

* Fix: Fix `unix://` addresses for Unix domain socket (UDS) paths
  (#100 by @clue)

* Feature: Forward compatibility with Stream v1.0 and v0.7
  (#99 by @clue)

## 0.7.2 (2017-04-24)

* Fix: Work around latest PHP 7.0.18 and 7.1.4 no longer accepting full URIs
  (#94 by @clue)

## 0.7.1 (2017-04-10)

* Fix: Ignore HHVM errors when closing connection that is already closing
  (#91 by @clue)

## 0.7.0 (2017-04-10)

* Feature: Merge SocketClient component into this component
  (#87 by @clue)

  This means that this package now provides async, streaming plaintext TCP/IP
  and secure TLS socket server and client connections for ReactPHP.

  ```
  $connector = new React\Socket\Connector($loop);
  $connector->connect('google.com:80')->then(function (ConnectionInterface $conn) {
      $connection->write('…');
  });
  ```

  Accordingly, the `ConnectionInterface` is now used to represent both incoming
  server side connections as well as outgoing client side connections.

  If you've previously used the SocketClient component to establish outgoing
  client connections, upgrading should take no longer than a few minutes.
  All classes have been merged as-is from the latest `v0.7.0` release with no
  other changes, so you can simply update your code to use the updated namespace
  like this:

  ```php
  // old from SocketClient component and namespace
  $connector = new React\SocketClient\Connector($loop);
  $connector->connect('google.com:80')->then(function (ConnectionInterface $conn) {
      $connection->write('…');
  });

  // new
  $connector = new React\Socket\Connector($loop);
  $connector->connect('google.com:80')->then(function (ConnectionInterface $conn) {
      $connection->write('…');
  });
  ```

## 0.6.0 (2017-04-04)

* Feature: Add `LimitingServer` to limit and keep track of open connections
  (#86 by @clue)

  ```php
  $server = new Server(0, $loop);
  $server = new LimitingServer($server, 100);

  $server->on('connection', function (ConnectionInterface $connection) {
      $connection->write('hello there!' . PHP_EOL);
      …
  });
  ```

* Feature / BC break: Add `pause()` and `resume()` methods to limit active
  connections
  (#84 by @clue)

  ```php
  $server = new Server(0, $loop);
  $server->pause();

  $loop->addTimer(1.0, function() use ($server) {
      $server->resume();
  });
  ```

## 0.5.1 (2017-03-09)

* Feature: Forward compatibility with Stream v0.5 and upcoming v0.6
  (#79 by @clue)

## 0.5.0 (2017-02-14)

* Feature / BC break: Replace `listen()` call with URIs passed to constructor
  and reject listening on hostnames with `InvalidArgumentException`
  and replace `ConnectionException` with `RuntimeException` for consistency
  (#61, #66 and #72 by @clue)

  ```php
  // old
  $server = new Server($loop);
  $server->listen(8080);

  // new
  $server = new Server(8080, $loop);
  ```

  Similarly, you can now pass a full listening URI to the constructor to change
  the listening host:

  ```php
  // old
  $server = new Server($loop);
  $server->listen(8080, '127.0.0.1');

  // new
  $server = new Server('127.0.0.1:8080', $loop);
  ```

  Trying to start listening on (DNS) host names will now throw an
  `InvalidArgumentException`, use IP addresses instead:

  ```php
  // old
  $server = new Server($loop);
  $server->listen(8080, 'localhost');

  // new
  $server = new Server('127.0.0.1:8080', $loop);
  ```

  If trying to listen fails (such as if port is already in use or port below
  1024 may require root access etc.), it will now throw a `RuntimeException`,
  the `ConnectionException` class has been removed:

  ```php
  // old: throws React\Socket\ConnectionException
  $server = new Server($loop);
  $server->listen(80);

  // new: throws RuntimeException
  $server = new Server(80, $loop);
  ```

* Feature / BC break: Rename `shutdown()` to `close()` for consistency throughout React
  (#62 by @clue)

  ```php
  // old
  $server->shutdown();

  // new
  $server->close();
  ```

* Feature / BC break: Replace `getPort()` with `getAddress()`
  (#67 by @clue)

  ```php
  // old
  echo $server->getPort(); // 8080

  // new
  echo $server->getAddress(); // 127.0.0.1:8080
  ```

* Feature / BC break: `getRemoteAddress()` returns full address instead of only IP
  (#65 by @clue)

  ```php
  // old
  echo $connection->getRemoteAddress(); // 192.168.0.1

  // new
  echo $connection->getRemoteAddress(); // 192.168.0.1:51743
  ```
  
* Feature / BC break: Add `getLocalAddress()` method
  (#68 by @clue)

  ```php
  echo $connection->getLocalAddress(); // 127.0.0.1:8080
  ```

* BC break: The `Server` and `SecureServer` class are now marked `final`
  and you can no longer `extend` them
  (which was never documented or recommended anyway).
  Public properties and event handlers are now internal only.
  Please use composition instead of extension.
