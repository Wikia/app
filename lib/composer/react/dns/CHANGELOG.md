# Changelog

## 0.4.12 (2018-01-14)

*   Improve test suite by adding forward compatibility with PHPUnit 6,
    test against PHP 7.2, fix forward compatibility with upcoming EventLoop releases,

    and add minor documentation improvements.
    (#85 and #87 by @carusogabriel, #88 and #89 by @clue and #83 by @jsor)

## 0.4.11 (2017-08-25)

*   Feature: Support resolving from default hosts file
    (#75, #76 and #77 by @clue)

    This means that resolving hosts such as `localhost` will now work as
    expected across all platforms with no changes required:

    ```php
    $resolver->resolve('localhost')->then(function ($ip) {
        echo 'IP: ' . $ip;
    });
    ```

    The new `HostsExecutor` exists for advanced usage and is otherwise used
    internally for this feature.
